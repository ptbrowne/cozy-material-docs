A shareable configuration for Cozy Applications or Scripts. This package is a Babel preset already used by create-cozy-app . To install: yarn add --dev babel-preset-cozy-app Usage with a Create Cozy App projects If you started your project using create-cozy-app , you don t need to do anything, you should already have a .babelrc configured to used this preset. Usage with other projects If you want to use this preset, you first need to have Babel installed (cf documentation ). Then, in a file named .babelrc (the Babel configuration file), you can use the preset using the following way: { presets : [ cozy-app ] } Options node (boolean): false by default By default, this babel preset targets browsers but you can target node by using the node option: { presets : [ [ cozy-app , { node : true }] ] } react (boolean): true by default By default, this babel preset uses the react preset ( babel-preset-react ) but you can disable this behaviour with the react option to false as following: { presets : [ [ cozy-app , { react : false }] ] } transformRegenerator (boolean): true by default (for browsers only) By default, this babel preset uses babel-plugin-transform-runtime to transform regenerator functions on the runtime. But sometimes (not always) it could break CSPs due to some eval usage so you can disable this behaviour with the transformRegenerator option to false as following: { presets : [ [ cozy-app , { transformRegenerator : false }] ] } Lib option When the lib option is activated, import/export nodes are not transpiled. This gives the downstream bundler the ability to prune unused module away. It works by configuring babel-preset-env with {\"modules\": false} . Advanced You can have control on the options passed to babel-preset-env and babel-plugin-transform-runtime : presetEnv will be passed to babel-preset-env transformRuntime will be passed to babel-plugin-transform-runtime { presets : [ [ cozy-app , { presetEnv : { modules : false }, transformRuntime : { helpers : true } }] ] } In this case, we do not want preset-env to touch to import/export and want the inlined Babel helpers to be replaced by imports from babel-runtime .

according to some options. Requirements Node.js version 8 or higher; Install yarn add --dev cozy-app-publish Registry documentation You can find more information about the registry and how to prepare an application to be published in the official registry documentation . Usage via Travis CI (recommended) First of all, don t forget to build the application: # build the application (in the ./build folder here) yarn build Then, just publish it using the Travis CI workflow: # publish it, REGISTRY_TOKEN should be # encrypted and provided via Travis CI environment # BUILD_COMMIT is your last build commit hash (git rev-parse build) yarn cozy-app-publish \\ --token $REGISTRY_TOKEN \\ --build-commit $BUILD_COMMIT Manual usage (not recommended) First of all, don t forget to build the application: # build the application (in the ./build folder here) yarn build Then, just publish it using: yarn cozy-app-publish \\ --token $REGISTRY_TOKEN \\ --build-url https://github.com/cozy/cozy-collect/archive/042cef26d9d33ea604fe4364eaab569980b500c9.tar.gz \\ --manual-version 1.0.2-dev.042cef26d9d33ea604fe4364eaab569980b500c9 Options --token editor-token (required) The registry editor token. This token must match the editor name and is provided by Cozy Cloud (with the name) in order to use the registry. --build-dir relative-path The path to the build folder, relative to the current directory. Since the standard Cozy application builds in the build/ folder, build is the default value. This folder is mainly used to read the application manifest during publishing. --build-url url For now, the registry a build archive (.tar.gz file) from an external link to be used in the cozy-stack. In the travis script, this url is computed using the Github trick to get archives from a commit url (but it s overwritten if provided by this option). For the manual script, we have to provide it. --build-commit commit-hash Using the travis mode, the archive tarball URL is computed using github and the build commit hash. If you are not on your build branch to publish, you can specify the correct build commit hash using this parameter. --manual-version version (required for manual usage only) In the manual mode, we don t have a way to compute the version like in the Travis mode for example. So we have to provide it using this option. --prepublish script_path Specify custom prepublish hook to manage how the app archive is generated and uploaded. The script must export a asynchronous function which has the following signature: module . exports = async ({ appBuildUrl , appSlug , appType , appVersion , buildCommit , registryUrl , registryEditor , registryToken , spaceName }) = { // ... } This function must return an object containing the same options given as parameter, which can have been updated. For example, you may specifiy a new appBuildUrl in the hook. Here s a description of the different options: Options Description appBuildUrl The url where the build can be retrieved. For example, http://github.com/cozy/cozy-foo/archives/cozy-foo.tar.gz appSlug The slug of the application, as defined in the manifest. Should not be mutated appType webapp or konnector appVersion App version, as defined in the manifest. Should not be mutated. buildCommit sha of the commit, should not be mutated. registryUrl URL of the Cozy registry, should not be mutated. registryEditor Editor as it appears in the Cozy registry. registryToken Registry Token. See registry documentation . Should not be mutated. spaceName Space name in the Cozy registry. --postpublish script_path Works exactly like the prepublish option, but will be executed after the publication. Multiple hooks and built-in hooks You can specify more than one hook by separating them with a , : cozy-app-publish --prepublish hook_name , other_hook_name Some hooks are shipped with cozy-app-publish and can be used by specifying their name: cozy-app-publish --prepublish builtin_hook_name Downcloud prepublish hook cozy-app-publish --prepublish downcloud This hook allows to upload the app to our downcloud server and sets the appBuildUrl accordingly. In order to upload files to our downcloud server, you will need to generate a new pair of RSA keys, add the private key to your ssh-agent and make sure the corresponding public key is present on the downcloud server. Here s how to do it: Generate a new key pair with ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f id_rsa_downcloud_myapp -C downcloud_myapp_deploy . Communicate the public key to someone who can deposit it on the downcloud server. If you re running things locally, you ll want to run ssh-add id_rsa_downcloud_myapp to add it to your ssh-agent. If you re planing to run this cozy-app-publish on Travis, you ll want to encrypt that file first . Run travis encrypt-file id_rsa_downcloud_myapp and copy the output. To add the key to Travis s ssh-agent, add the following lines in the before_install section of your .travis.yml , but don t forget to paste the output of travis encrypt-file where it s needed. - if [ $TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS != false ]; then PASTE_TRAVIS_ENCRYPT_OUTPUT_HERE; fi - if [ $TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS != false ]; then eval $(ssh-agent -s) ; fi - if [ $TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS != false ]; then chmod 600 id_rsa_downcloud_myapp; fi - if [ $TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS != false ]; then ssh-add id_rsa_downcloud_myapp; fi We recommend changing the path used for the private key. You can change the -out argument of the command output by travis encrypt-file and the corresponding path s in the commands above. /tmp/id_rsa_downcloud_myapp is a good place to store this key. Finally, secure the private key . If you re using Travis, the key is now stored by Travis so you should delete your local copy. If you re running things on your machine, make sure the private key doesn t end up in version control. Rundeck postpublish hook cozy-app-publish --postpublish rundeck Deploys the app on rundeck. This hook requires several variables to be set as environment variables: RUNDECK_TOKEN : the token to use to interact with the Rundeck API. To obtain such a token, ask someone that has admin privileges on the rundeck server. TARGETS_DEV : a comma-separated list of instances to deploy the app on, on the dev channel. TARGETS_BETA : a comma-separated list of instances to deploy the app on, on the beta channel. TARGETS_STABLE : a comma-separated list of instances to deploy the app on, on the stable channel. Mattermost postpublish hook cozy-app-publish --postpublish mattermost Sends a message to a mattermost channel to notify of the app s deployment. Requires the following options: MATTERMOST_HOOK_URL : You will need to set up a new Incoming Hook . MATTERMOST_CHANNEL : The name of the channel messages will be posted to. --registry-url url The url of the registry, by default it will be https://staging-apps-registry.cozycloud.cc. --space space-name Use this options to provide a specific space name of the registry to publish the application in. By default it will be published in the default space. --verbose To print more logs when using tool (useful for debug). Recommended workflow Day to day Development is done on feature branches that are merged into master , once they are complete. Every time someone commits on master , a new archive is created and uploaded on Downcloud and it is then deployed on a test instance with Rundeck. Release workflow A new branch is created from the current state of master . Let s say we want to deploy version 1.0.0 of the app. The only type of commits allowed on this release branch are bug fixes. Every time one or more bugs are fixed and the version is considered for release, the latest commit is tagged with a prerelease version number, eg. 1.0.0-beta.1 , 1.0.0-beta.2 , etc\u2026 Each of these prereleases is automatically uploaded on downcloud and deployed on instances that are on the beta channel. Once the branch is deemed ready for release, the last commit is tagged with the final version \u2014 1.0.0 in our example. It is then, again, uploaded on downcloud, published on the registry and deployed on specific instances as needed. The release branch is merged back into master so that all the bugfixes aren t lost.","title":"cozy-app-publish"},{"location":"cozy-app-publish/#cozy-app-publish","text":"","title":"Cozy App Publish"},{"location":"cozy-app-publish/#whats-cozy-app-publish","text":"cozy-app-publish is a command line tool that publish a Cozy application to the Cozy registry according to some options.","title":"What's cozy-app-publish?"},{"location":"cozy-app-publish/#requirements","text":"Node.js version 8 or higher;","title":"Requirements"},{"location":"cozy-app-publish/#install","text":"yarn add --dev cozy-app-publish","title":"Install"},{"location":"cozy-app-publish/#registry-documentation","text":"You can find more information about the registry and how to prepare an application to be published in the official registry documentation .","title":"Registry documentation"},{"location":"cozy-app-publish/#usage-via-travis-ci-recommended","text":"First of all, don t forget to build the application: # build the application (in the ./build folder here) yarn build Then, just publish it using the Travis CI workflow: # publish it, REGISTRY_TOKEN should be # encrypted and provided via Travis CI environment # BUILD_COMMIT is your last build commit hash (git rev-parse build) yarn cozy-app-publish \\ --token $REGISTRY_TOKEN \\ --build-commit $BUILD_COMMIT","title":"Usage via Travis CI (recommended)"},{"location":"cozy-app-publish/#manual-usage-not-recommended","text":"First of all, don t forget to build the application: # build the application (in the ./build folder here) yarn build Then, just publish it using: yarn cozy-app-publish \\ --token $REGISTRY_TOKEN \\ --build-url https://github.com/cozy/cozy-collect/archive/042cef26d9d33ea604fe4364eaab569980b500c9.tar.gz \\ --manual-version 1.0.2-dev.042cef26d9d33ea604fe4364eaab569980b500c9","title":"Manual usage (not recommended)"},{"location":"cozy-app-publish/#options","text":"","title":"Options"},{"location":"cozy-app-publish/#-token-lteditor-tokengt-required","text":"The registry editor token.

The cozy-apps-registry is a go project that implements the registry API described to work with the cozy-stack . To work properly, it requires: - Couchdb = 2.0 - Openstack Object Storage (Swift) How to develop with a cozy-apps-registry working in local environment Before starting, you will need to have a couchdb running already. That can be the one used by the local cozy-stack if you have one. For this tutorial, couchdb will be running on the default port 5984. You also must have an OpenStack Object Storage (Swift) up and running. You can follow install instructions on the official website 1) Install and configure the local cozy-apps-registry Since this is a golang project, you can install it using go with the followed command: go get -u github.com/cozy/cozy-apps-registry cd $GOPATH /src/github.com/cozy/cozy-apps-registry/ Then you will need a session secret key to run the registry (this key will be store in the sessionsecret.key file of your working directory) using a password: cozy-apps-registry gen-session-secret --passphrase sessionsecret.key This password is important, you will need it to run the cozy-apps-registry again later. If you lose it, you will have to start again these steps. 2) Configure the registry with cozy-registry.yml Before running the registry, you have to configure it correctly. Don t worry, here is the .yaml file to copy and paste in your cozy-registry.yml (should be in the root folder of cozy-registry/ ): :bulb: You can find an example of this configuration file at the root of the directory. # server host (serve command) - flag --host host : localhost # server port (serve command) - flag --port port : 8081 couchdb : # CouchDB server url - flag --couchdb-url url : http://localhost:5984 # CouchDB user - flag --couchdb-user user : # CouchDB password - flag --couchdb-password password : # CouchDB prefix for the registries databases - flag --couchdb-prefix prefix : registry1 swift : # Swift auth URL (provided by keystone) auth_url : http://172.28.128.3/identity/v3 # Swift username username : admin # Swift password api_key : secret # Endpoint type (public/admin/internal) endpointy_type : public # Project name tenant : demo # Swift domain domain : default # Path to the session secret file containing the master secret to generate # session token. # # Should be generated with the gen-session-secret command. session-secret : sessionsecret.key Feel free to change it if some configurations change in your case (the couchdb user, the server parameters or the databases prefix for example). Notices : - Here the generated session token (step 1) is stored in the sessionsecret.key file of the working directory, this is so the value of the property session-secret at the end of the configuration file. - By default, the local couchdb allow all admin accesses without creating users, so there is no user and password here. But if an admin user has been created, you have to use the properties user and password in the couchdb part to provide these informations. It s also possible to use env variables for configuration. You can take the key from the configuration file and add the COZY_REGISTRY prefix. For example, you can run: COZY_REGISTRY_PORT = 8081 cozy-apps-registry serve There is also the REGISTRY_SESSION_PASS env variable for the password for the session secret. 3) Run the registry to serve the apps Run the registry using this followed command (here our configuration file is a cozy-registry.yml in the current working directory): cozy-apps-registry serve -c cozy-registry.yml At this step, you should have a cozy-apps-registry running and ready for the development. If you runnig the registry for the first time you can see the next steps to create a new editor and to configure your local cozy-stack to run with this new registry. The -c options is always mandatory if you want to specify a config file like here. 4) Create an editor This step is required to submit new applications in the registry. In another terminal, run these commands to create an editor (the one that will submit the application(s)) and generate an access token: cozy-apps-registry add-editor Cozy -c cozy-registry.yml cozy-apps-registry gen-token --master Cozy -c cozy-registry.yml Here we go, you have now an registry ready and running on the 8081 port. The -c options is always mandatory if you want to specify a config file like here. 5) Configure cozy-stack with the registry On the cozy-stack , you have to add the new registry in the stack configuration file cozy.yaml (registries property): ... registries : default : - http://localhost:8081/ ... Now restart your local cozy-stack to take this new configuration in consideration (stop and run again cozy-stack serve ) and you re ready to work with the cozy-apps-registry ! Publish your application on the registry If you need more details about the registry you can go to the official registry documentation :warning: Important: In this whole documentation, by the term application , we mean a web application or a konnector. Indeed, for the registry, all entities are applications and they can be either webapp or konnector type. 1) Prepare your application For an application To be publishable, your application requires some informations in its manifest.webapp , the manifest of a Cozy application. Here is an example for the application Drive: \u0002wzxhzdk:7\u0003 For a connector To be publishable, your konnector requires some informations in its manifest.konnector , the manifest of a Cozy konnector. Here is an example for the konnector cozy-konnector-trainline : \u0002wzxhzdk:8\u0003 Properties meaning (reference) Here are all properties meaning for the manifest file (for webapp and konnectors) sorted alphabetically: Field Description aggregator Object containing aggregator data. Typically { accountId: 'aggregator-service' } . categories array of categories for your apps (see authorized categories), it will be ['others'] by default if empty data_types (konnector specific) Array of the data type the konnector will manage developer name and url for the developer editor the editor s name to display on the cozy-bar ( REQUIRED ) fields (konnector specific) JSON object describing the fields need by the konnector ( except folder path ). Used to generate a form. See collect documentation folders (konnector specific) A list of folders required by the konnector to store files according to datatype (see the specific documentation below ) frequency (konnector specific) A human readable value between monthly , weekly , daily , indicating the interval of time between two runs of the konnector. Default : weekly . icon path to the icon for the home (path in the build) intents (application specific) a list of intents provided by this app (see cozy-stack intents doc for more details) langs Languages available in your app (can be different from locales) language (konnector specific) the konnector development language used (ex: node ) license the SPDX license identifier locales an object with language slug as property, each name property is an object of localized informations (see the second part below) manifest_version The current manifest version used. This is a versioning for the manifest and allow better retrocompatiblity when processing app manifest messages (konnector specific) Array of message identifiers, which can be used by application to display information at known areas. See example in collect documentation . name the name to display on the home ( REQUIRED ) name_prefix the prefix to display with the name oauth (konnector specific) JSON object containing oAuth information, like scope . If a manifest provides an oauth property, it is considered as an OAuth konnector. parameters (konnector specific) Additional parameters which should be passed to the konnector. Used for example for bank konnectors to pass a bankId parameter. partnership an object to provide informations (to display in the Store for example) about a partnership related to the application ( icon description , name and domain ) permissions a map of permissions needed by the app (see see cozy-stack permissions doc for more details) platforms (application specific) List of objects for platform native applications. For now there are only two properties: type (i.e. 'ios' or 'linux' ) and the optional url to reach this application page. routes (application specific) a map of routes for the app (see cozy-stack routes doc for more details) ( REQUIRED ) screenshots an array of paths to the screenshots of the application (paths in the build) services (application specific) a map of the services associated with the app (see cozy-stack services doc for more details) slug the default slug that should never change (alpha-numeric lowercase) ( REQUIRED ) source where the files of the app can be downloaded (by default it will look for the branch build ) tags a list a tags describing your application and features (useful for indexing and search) terms an object defining properties for terms that need to be displayed/accepted by the user when installing the application ( more-info-below ) time_interval (konnector specific) By defaults, konnector triggers are scheduled randomly between 00:00 AM and 05:00 AM. Those two values can be overwritten thanks to this property, by passing an array containing two values: first is the interval start hour, second is the interval end hour. Example: [15, 21] will randomly schedule the konnector trigger between 15:00 (03:00 PM) and 21:00 (09:00 PM). The time zone used is GMT. type type of application ( konnector or webapp ) ( REQUIRED ) version the current version number ( REQUIRED ) vendor_link (konnector specific) URL to editor or service website Notices: - All images paths ( icon , partnership.icon and screenshots ) should be relative to the build directory. For example, here, the icon.svg is stored in the build root directory and all screenshots are store in a folder screenshots in the build directory. Therefore, if you use a bundler (like webpack) be sure to know exactly where the bundler will store these assets in the build directory (and change it in the manifest if needed). - All properties in locales objects will override the matched property of the main manifest.webapp body, if a property is not found in locales it will fallback to the main body one. - We use to have the en locale as default one if the one wanted by the user doesn t exist. Be sure to have, at least, that locale complete with the name and all descriptions. - In your build files, this manifest.webapp file must be at the root. Translated manifest fields Here are the properties that you can override using locales (we recommand to automatically build these properties according to your locales files if you re using a translating tool like transifex ) : name short_description long_description changes screenshots folders Application terms You can provide a related terms property if you want to display and make the user accept some terms (ToS for example) just before installing the application. Here are all properties allowed and used: url , the URL of the terms/contract to redirect the user to ( REQUIRED ) version : A specific version of the terms, we need it handle terms updates and ask the user again to accept the update. The special characters [*+~.()'\"!:@] are not allowed here. ( REQUIRED ) id : An id for the terms. When accepting terms, we store in io.cozy.terms , a document containing the id and version so that we know which terms have been accepted, and show the user a modal if the terms have not been accepted yet. The special characters [*+~.()'\"!:@] are not allowed here. ( REQUIRED ) Konnectors folders handling The folders property is a list of objects with these following properties: defaultDir : ( REQUIRED ) The default root directory of your folder. In this folder will automatically be created a subfolder with the konnector name and into this latter a subfolder with the account name to store the related files. Here you can use some variables in the path like the following: $administrative : Folder which will receive all administrative related files (bills, contracts, invoices ) $photos : Folder which will receive all photos $konnector : The name of the konnector :warning: All paths provided using defaultDir will be the root directory, not the final folder which will receive the files. For example, if you set $photos , the final folder will be $photos/$konnector/$account in order to keep them always sorted by konnectors and accounts. 2) Add a new application in the registry Our official apps registry Official registry URL: https://apps-registry.cozycloud.cc In order to use our official repository, you need a token for a specific editor. To do so, contact us directly at the address contact@cozycloud.cc with a mail using the following title prefix: [registry] and provide us these folowing information (not changeable after): - slug of your application - editor name that you want We will provide you with the correct token. Custom registry See the details below to know how to add a new application in a custom cozy-apps-registry instance (local or not). Prequisites : - For this step, you will need your editor token access generated when you created your editor (see below ). You have to replace all {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} in this documentation by this token. - The communication with the registry is done through HTTP requests for now. So we will use the curl command line tool to register our application here. Now you can add your application in the registry. This step is splitted in two septs: - Add a new application (without versions) - Add a version of the application :pushpin: A new application without registered version won t be displayed by the cozy-store application . To add a new application, you have to do a POST request which all the informations needed to the route registryAddress/registry with registryAddress your registry address (for example here http://localhost:8081 ). Let s add the Collect application as example: # {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} - your generated editor access token curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/registry \\ -H Authorization: Token {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} \\ -H Content-Type: application/json \\ -d $ { slug : collect , type : webapp , editor : {{EDITOR}} } Field Description slug your application unique ID type kind of application (it can be only webapp or konnector ) editor Name of the editor matching the {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} :warning: Here the slug is the unique ID of the application in the registry, so it can t be changed after the application is already registered. 3) Add a new version of a registered application Via cozy-app-publish (highly recommanded) Here we will show the classical way to add a version using the manual mode of cozy-app-publish as reference. But you may need to look at the Automation CI part of this documentation instead. Prequisites : - For this step, you will need your editor token access generated when you created your editor (see below ). You have to replace all {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} in this documentation by this token. - Don t forget to build your application first (run yarn build ), cozy-app-publish will read the manifest from your build Firstly, install the cozy-app-publish package using yarn or npm : yarn add cozy-app-publish --dev You can also install the package as a global package, but don t forget to update it frequently Then use it to publish your application, here is an example for collect : yarn cozy-app-publish \\ --token {{ EDITOR_TOKEN }} \\ --build-url https://github.com/cozy/cozy-collect/archive/042cef26d9d33ea604fe4364eaab569980b500c9.tar.gz \\ --manual-version 1.0.2-dev.042cef26d9d33ea604fe4364eaab569980b500c9 If you need more information about this tool, you can go to the official cozy-app-publish documentation . Via curl Here we will show the classical way to add a version using curl as reference. But you may need to look at our dedicated tool cozy-app-publish or the Automation CI part of this documentation instead. Prequisites : - For this step, you will need your editor token access generated when you created your editor (see below ). You have to replace all {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} in this documentation by this token. - The communication with the registry is done through HTTP requests for now. So we will use the curl command line tool to register our application here. To add a new application, you have to do a POST request which all the informations needed to the route registryAddress/registry/:appSlug with registryAddress your registry address (for example here http://localhost:8081 ), :appName your application slug (here drive ). Let s add the version 1.0.1 of the Collect application as example: # {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} - your generated editor access token curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/registry/collect \\ -H Authorization: Token {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} \\ -H Content-Type: application/json \\ -d $ { url : https://github.com/cozy/cozy-collect/archive/1.0.1.tar.gz , sha256 : 96212bf53ab618808da0a92c7b6d9f2867b1f9487ba7c1c29606826b107041b5 , version : 1.0.1 , type : webapp , editor : {{EDITOR}} } Field Description url the archive source of your application, it will be downloaded and checked with the sha256 property sha256 the sha256 hash of your source archive matching the archive in url (see the notice below) version version of the application, must match the one in the manifest (see the notice below) type kind of application (it can be only webapp or konnector ) editor Name of the editor matching the {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} :warning: Important notices: - The version must match the one in the manifest.webapp file for stable release. For beta (X.X.X-betaX) or dev releases (X.X.X-dev.hash256), the version before the cyphen must match the one in the manifest.webapp . - For better integrity, the sha256 provided must match the sha256 of the archive provided in url . If it s not the case, that will be considered as an error and the version won t be registered. Spaces Virtual Spaces Spaces You can divide your applications between several isolated places, called spaces . When an application and its versions are published in a space , they are only reachable in that one (you can consider a space like a entire sub-part of the registry). It is espacially useful for splitting up applications by logical topics. Most of the CLI and API endpoints have a space option. You can refer to the documentation or CLI help to view all available parameters. Create a space Spaces are defined in the config file and are automatically created during registry launching. Add a space entry, followed by your spaces names, and let the registry do the work: spaces : __default__ myspace foospace Remove a space To remove a space, you have to clean all the remaining apps versions before removing the space entry name. A CLI is available for the job: $ cozy-apps-registry rm-space your-space Example: $ cozy-apps-registry rm-space foobar Warning: You are going to remove space foobar and all its applications. This action is irreversible. Please enter the space name to confirm: foobar Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.f26bf2b8db3da459071a074a1367ce36e78bb34c Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.cf1efba4c1b6dd08bb5857f5752790f0d2663d6d Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.0bbd57a6ce50af82cfbefb8c231fbfe04516e742 Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.21338229a0c2317dc0f3b94e92b22a367f84c537 Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.08ab3624136fb70dc996003aebc3049af51f7438 Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.4e9d174a3b01acaf8a44b561455efc3f34871142 Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.b2654bf00be393aa611fcbb7f70a8ef671895a84 Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.860861868a5dfe294c7120d81fa9feb5387bb57f Removing app2/0.1.9-dev.954dac9e12e080d591cb76591c311611fed1bea9 You can now delete the name from your config file. Virtual Spaces A virtual space is necessarily built over an existing space . It allows to filter by selecting or rejecting applications available on the underlying space. :warning: Please note that a virtual space does not have any database document or associated swift object, it does only enforce filters on a space . Therefore, it is not possible to publish applications or versions on a virtual space . Automation (CI) The following tutorial explains how to connect your continuous integration based on Travis to automatically publish new versions on the apps registry. In this tutorial, we assume: you have a token allowing you to publish applications for your editor : {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} you are working on a repository plugged on travis and named on github myname/cozy-example You first need to add the token to your travis configuration file .travis.yml . To do so, you need the travis utility to encrypt its value. $ travis encrypt REGISTRY_TOKEN ={{ EDITOR_TOKEN }} -r myname/cozy-example --org Please add the following to your .travis.yml file: secure: jUAjk..LOOOOONG_ENCRYPTED_STRING.....jdk89= Like said, you need to add this block of ciphered data in the .travis.yml (if it s not already done automatically). This will allow you to use the REGISTRY_TOKEN variable in your deployment script. Then, you can add the publish script in your package.json in order to be used by Travis: ... publish:cozy : git fetch origin ${DEPLOY_BRANCH:-build}:${DEPLOY_BRANCH:-build} cozy-app-publish --token $REGISTRY_TOKEN --build-commit $(git rev-parse ${DEPLOY_BRANCH:-build}) ... This script will fetch your last commit from the build branch to publish to the registry. If you push a tag, be sure to wait the last build branch Travis build finished in order to have the real last commit to publish. Finally, you can add this script to your .travis.yml to publish your app using our publishing tool cozy-app-publish during the deploy process: ... before_deploy: - yarn add cozy-app-publish deploy: - provider: script repo: myname/cozy-example skip-cleanup: true script: export DEPLOY_BRANCH=build yarn deploy yarn publish:cozy on: branch: master - provider: script repo: myname/cozy-example skip-cleanup: true script: export DEPLOY_BRANCH=build yarn publish:cozy on: tags: true ... Important notices: - A commit push to the branch master will publish your application in the dev channel of the registry. - A tag push (Github release) will publish a stable version (ex: 1.0.0 ) or a beta version (ex: 1.0.1-beta2 ) to the registry (automatically handled by the registry). - cozy-app-publish will use the github archive URL computing to get the application tarball. If your applicaiton is not on Github, you may need to use the manual mode of the command. Access to our official apps registry Official registry URL: https://apps-registry.cozycloud.cc In order to use our official repository, you need a token for a specific editor. To do so, contact us directly at the address contact@cozycloud.cc with a mail using the following title prefix: [registry] and provide us these folowing information (not changeable after): - slug of your application - editor name that you want We will provide you with the correct token. Access control and tokens The read-only routes of the registry are all public and do not require any access-contre. However routes allowing to create applications and versions have access-control policies associated to them. The registry has two types of access permissions, that are associated to two different tokens: editor tokens : these tokens give access to the publication of new versions on the registry, for a specific editor name, at these conditions: the version s application must already exist in the registry the version s application must have the same editor value as the token master tokens : these tokens are allowed to create and register new applications on the registry, and associate them with an existing editor name. They also have the same accesses as the editor tokens. Editor tokens can be specific to one or more applications names that they are allowed to publish. In order to create tokens, the binary offers a gen-token command-line. Here are some examples to illustrates some usages: # Generating tokens # generate an editor token for the editor cozy , for any application $ cozy-apps-registry gen-token cozy # generate an editor token for the editor cozy expiring after 30 days $ cozy-apps-registry gen-token cozy --max-age 30d # generate an editor token for the editor cozy for application collect and drive $ cozy-apps-registry gen-token cozy --apps collect,drive # generate a master token associated with the editor cozy expiring after 30 days $ cozy-apps-registry gen-token cozy --master --max-age 30d # Verifying tokens # verify the editor token XXX for the editor cozy $ cozy-apps-registry verify-token cozy XXX # verify the master token XXX associated with the editor cozy $ cozy-apps-registry verify-token cozy XXX --master # Revoking tokens # revoke all editors tokens for the cozy editor $ cozy-apps-registry revoke-tokens cozy # revoke all master tokens associated with the cozy editor $ cozy-apps-registry revoke-tokens cozy --master Maintenance In order to set/unset an application into maintenance mode, the binary offers a maintenance command-line. Here are some examples of how to use it: # Activate maintenance mode for the application bank of space myspace # Available flagged options: # --infra specify a maintenance specific to our infra # --no-manual-exec specify a maintenance disallowing manual execution # --short specify a short maintenance $ cozy-apps-registry maintenance activate bank --space myspace # Deactivate maintenance mode for the application bank of space myspace $ cozy-apps-registry maintenance deactivate bank --space myspace Or using a cURL request and a master token: curl -XPUT \\ -H Authorization: Token $COZY_REGISTRY_ADMIN_TOKEN \\ -H Content-Type: application/json \\ -d { flag_infra_maintenance : false, flag_short_maintenance : false, flag_disallow_manual_exec : false, messages : { fr : { long_message : Bla bla bla , short_message : Bla }, en : { long_message : Yadi yadi yada , short_message : Yada }}} \\ https://apps-registry.cozycloud.cc/myspace/registry/maintenance/bank/activate curl -XPUT \\ -H Authorization: Token $COZY_REGISTRY_ADMIN_TOKEN \\ https://apps-registry.cozycloud.cc/registry/maintenance/bank/deactivate Application confidence grade / labelling The confidence grade of an applications can be specified by specifying the data_usage_commitment and data_usage_commitment_by fields of the application document. Possible values for these properties are: data_usage_commitment : specify a technical commitment from the application editor: user_ciphered : technical commitment that the user s data is encrypted and can only be known by him. user_reserved : commitment that the data is only used for the user, to directly offer its service. none : no commitment data_usage_commitment_by : specify what entity is taking the commitment: cozy : the commitment is taken by cozy editor : the commitment is taken by the application s editor none : no commitment is taken To do that, a command line and admin API are available, and be used as follow: $ cozy-apps-registry modify-app banks --space my_space --data-usage-commitment user_reserved --data-usage-commitment-by editor Or using a cURL request and a master token: curl -XPATCH \\ -H Authorization: Token $COZY_REGISTRY_ADMIN_TOKEN \\ -H Content-Type: application/json \\ -d { data_usage_commitment : user_reserved , data_usage_commitment_by : editor } https://apps-registry.cozycloud.cc/my_space/registry/banks Universal links The registry can manage Universal links . Configuration Config file Each space holds its own files. The space determination is based on the request host, so you must bind a domain to a space in the config file. domain_space : mycloud.com : __default__ cloud.foobar.com : foobar Files Place your files (e.g apple-app-site-association ) in the space container. The file must be prepended with universallink/ For the foobar space and file apple-app-site-association , the file has to be named universallink/apple-app-site-association and placed in the foobar container Usage The following endpoint is available to get any file: http:// yourdomain /.well-known/:filename You can now query your endpoint to get your file: curl -X GET http://cloud.foobar.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association { applinks : { apps : [] , details : [ { appID : 3AKXFMV43J.io.cozy.drive.mobile , paths : [ /drive ] } , { appID : 3AKXFMV43J.io.cozy.banks.mobile , paths : [ /banks ] } , { appID : 3AKXFMV43J.io.cozy.photos.mobile , paths : [ /photos ] } ] } } Community You can reach the Cozy Community by: Chatting with us on IRC #cozycloud on Freenode Posting on our Forum Posting issues on the Github repos Say Hi! on Twitter","title":"cozy-apps-registry"},{"location":"cozy-apps-registry/#cozy-apps-registry","text":"","title":"cozy-apps-registry"},{"location":"cozy-apps-registry/#whats-cozy","text":"Cozy is a platform that brings all your web services in the same private space.

Cozy Link is a simple yet powerful way to describe how you want to get the result of a query. Think of it as a sort of middleware . Links are units that you can chain together to define how each query should be handled: this allows us to use different sources of data, or to control the request lifecycle in a way that makes sense for your app. The first link operates on an operation object and each subsequent link operates on the result of the previous link: In the chain example pictured above, the Dedup link would avoid re-fetching the same query, the PouchDB link would try to get the data from a local Pouch instance, and fallback to the Stack link, assisted by the Retry link that will try to fetch again the query in case of a network error. Authoring a link There are two ways of creating a new link. First, you can instantiate a CozyLink and pass a request handling function to its constructor: const logLink = new CozyLink (( operation , result , forward ) = { console . log ( JSON . stringify ( operation )) return forward ( operation , result ) }) Or you can subclass CozyLink : class LogLink extends CozyLink { request ( operation , result , forward ) { console . log ( JSON . stringify ( operation )) return forward ( operation , result ) } } At the core of a link is the request method. It takes the following arguments: - operation : the operation definition being passed through the link ; - result : the (maybe incomplete) result processed by the previous link ; - forward : (optional) specifies the next link in the chain of links. When the request method is called, the link has to return data back. Depending on where the link is in the chain, and its ability to provide the requested data, it will either use the forward callback to defer to the next link the task of providing (or completing) the data, or return back a result on its own.","title":"Link authoring"},{"location":"cozy-client/link-authoring/#what-is-it","text":"Cozy Link is a simple yet powerful way to describe how you want to get the result of a query.

Support offline for some doctypes with cozy-pouch-link Using CozyClient on a mobile app Configuration \ud83d\udee0 On the web, the server pass the token and the domain to the page directly through template variables. This is not possible on mobile as there is no server to serve the page. CozyClient supports connecting to a Cozy via OAtuh. To get started, configure the OAuth settings when creating the client: import CozyClient from cozy-client const client = new CozyClient ({ uri : http://cozy.tools:8080 , scope : [ io.cozy.mydoctype ], oauth : { clientName : MyClient , softwareID : MyAppId , redirectURI : http://localhost } }) scope is an array of permissions you require for your client oauth is a list of fields that identify your client for the user and the server. The complete list of field can be found here , although they should be camel-cased instead of snake-cased. Starting the OAuth flow \ud83c\udfc4\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Before you can start making requests to the server, you will need to get a token. cozy-client will provide a URL to a page where the user is shown what data you want to access, and asking for his or her permission. After the user accepts these permissions, he or she is redirected to the oauth.redirectURI that you declared earlier. You will then have to give this redirected URL back to cozy-client as it contains a code, that will be exchanged for the token. To get started, you call client.startOAuthFlow like this: import CozyClient from cozy-client const client = new CozyClient ({ uri : http://cozy.tools:8080 , scope : [ io.cozy.mydoctype ], oauth : { clientName : MyClient , softwareID : MyAppId , redirectURI : http://localhost } }) client . startOAuthFlow ( openURL ) The openURL parameter is a callback. It will receive the URL to the page as a parameter, and it must return a Promise that resolves with the redirected URL. How exactly you do this depends on your environment \u2014 for a mobile app you may use a WebView, in a browser maybe a new tab\u2026 Here is an example that uses the browser s console and an experienced user: const openURL = url = { console . log ( Please visit the following URL, accept the permissions and copy the URL you are redirected to, then come back here. you have 10 seconds. , url ) return new Promise ( resolve = { setTimeout ( async () = { const returnUrl = prompt ( Paste the new URL here. ) resolve ( returnUrl ) }, 10000 ) }) } And that s it! After the promise is resolved, cozy-client finishes the OAuth flow and you can start using it. How to restore a previous token ? Nobody likes to enter passwords, and you don t want to make your user go through this whole process every time your app starts. In order to restore the client from a previous version, you need to give it a token and some extra information about itself. Both of these are returned by the openURL function, so you can store them wherever you see fit \u2014 in this example we ll use the localStorage API. import CozyClient from cozy-client const client = new CozyClient ({ uri : http://cozy.tools:8080 , scope : [ io.cozy.mydoctype ], oauth : { clientName : MyClient , softwareID : MyAppId , redirectURI : http://localhost } }) const { token , infos } = client . startOAuthFlow ( openURL ) localStorage . setItem ( token , token ) localStorage . setItem ( infos , JSON . stringify ( infos )) Next time your app starts, you can pass these informations to the constructor. Here is a complete example of the OAuth client initilisation: const storedToken = localStorage . getItem ( token ) || null const storedInfos = JSON . parse ( localStorage . getItem ( infos )) || { clientName : MyClient , softwareID : MyAppId , redirectURI : http://localhost } const client = new CozyClient ({ uri : http://cozy.tools:8080 , oauth : storedInfos , token : storedToken , scope : [ io.cozy.mydoctype ] }); if ( ! storedToken ) { const { token , infos } = await client . startOAuthFlow ( openURL ) localStorage . setItem ( token , token ) localStorage . setItem ( infos , JSON . stringify ( infos )) } How to logout the client ? When a user logout, we would like remove all references on this instance and remove all user data. You can just use cozyClient.logout() . Support offline for some doctypes with cozy-pouch-link If you are already using cozy-client and the StackLink , you may want to go further and store some documents locally so you can retrieve them even while being offline. Currently, you have a code like this one : import CozyClient , { StackLink } from cozy-client const stackLink = new StackLink () const client = new CozyClient ({ // ... links : [ stackLink ] }) To manage the offline aspect, we provide the cozy-pouch-link . First, let s install it : # using npm npm install cozy-pouch-link # using yarn yarn add cozy-pouch-link Then, we will create a new instance of this link and give it the list of doctypes that we want to access offline. We have to put the PouchLink first, so it is reached first when we query the link chain : import CozyClient , { StackLink } from cozy-client import PouchLink from cozy-pouch-link const stackLink = new StackLink () const offlineDoctypes = [ io.cozy.todos ] const pouchLink = new PouchLink ({ doctypes : offlineDoctypes , initialSync : true // whether you want to trigger the synchronization on login or not }) const client = new CozyClient ({ // ... links : [ pouchLink , stackLink ] }) The PouchLink will create the PouchDB databases for all offline doctypes and synchronize them with the distant CouchDB. All doctypes that are not managed by the PouchLink will be passed to the next link in the chain (in the previous example, the StackLink ).","title":"Mobile guide"},{"location":"cozy-client/mobile-guide/#using-cozyclient-on-a-mobile-app","text":"","title":"Using CozyClient on a mobile app"},{"location":"cozy-client/mobile-guide/#configuration","text":"On the web, the server pass the token and the domain to the page directly through template variables.

In addition to the Javascript client, Cozy-Client provides a way to connect directly the data from your Cozy instance to your React components. Once connected, your components will receive the requesting data and a fetch status in their props. The data will automatically be refreshed upon modification. Setup The following procedure requires you to already know how to initialize a CozyClient instance and create a query to fetch documents. 1. Initialize a CozyClient provider Import CozyClient and CozyProvider import CozyClient , { CozyProvider } from cozy-client Initialize a CozyClient instance (see the CozyClient() documentation for additional parameters, for example to provide a schema) const client = new CozyClient ({ uri : http://cozy.tools:8080 , token : ... }) Then wrap you React application inside a CozyProvider component with your newly instance of CozyClient in its props as client . function MyCozyApp ( props ) { return CozyProvider client = { client } MyApp { ...props } / / CozyProvider } ReactDOM . render ( MyCozyApp / , document . getElementById ( main ) ) The CozyClient will be available for consumption to all components inside your wrapped application. cozy-client uses redux internally to centralize the statuses of the various fetches and replications triggered by the library, and to store locally the data in a normalized way. If you already have a redux store in your app, you can configure cozy-client to use this existing store: import CozyClient , { CozyProvider } from cozy-client import { combineReducers , createStore , applyMiddleware } from redux const client = new CozyClient ({ uri : http://cozy.tools:8080 , token : ... }) const store = createStore ( combineReducers ({ ... myReducers , cozy : client . reducer () }), applyMiddleware ( myMiddleware ) ) function MyCozyApp ( props ) { return CozyProvider client = { client } store = { store } MyApp { ...props } / / CozyProvider } ReactDOM . render ( MyCozyApp / , document . getElementById ( main ) ) 2.a Requesting data with Query / To make it easy to fetch data and make it available to your component, we provide a Render Props component called Query . Basic example of usage: import { Query } from cozy-client const todos = io.cozy.todos const checked = { checked : false } const query = client = client . find ( todos ). where ( checked ) function TodoList ( props ) { return Query query = { query } { ({ data , fetchStatus }) = fetchStatus !== loaded ? h1 Loading ... / h1 : ul { data . map ( todo = li { todo . label } / li )} / ul } / Query } When we use Query to wrap a component, three things happen: - The query passed as a prop will be executed when Query mounts, resulting in the loading of data from the local Pouchdb (if any) or from the server; in the future it may load the data directly from the client-side store; - Query subscribes to the store, so that it is updated if the data changes; - Query passes the result of the query as props to the children function. The following props will be given to your wrapped component: - data : an array of documents - fetchStatus : the status of the fetch ( pending , loading , loaded or error ) - lastFetch : when the last fetch occured - hasMore : the fetches being paginated, this property indicates if there are more documents to load You can also pass a function intead of a direct query. Your function will be given the props of the component and should return the requested query: import { Query } from cozy-client const query = function ( props ) { const todos = io.cozy.todos const where = { checked : props . checked } return client = client . find ( todos ). where ( where ) } function TodoList () { return Query query = { query } checked = { props . checked } { ({ data , fetchStatus }) = fetchStatus !== loaded ? h1 Loading ... / h1 : ul { data . map ( todo = li { todo . label } / li )} / ul } / Query } // use TodoList checked={false} / Note: Your query will be bound when the Query/ component mounts. Future changes in props will not modify the query. 2.b Requesting data with the queryConnect HOC At your preference, you can use an higher-order component. queryConnect will take the name of the props field where it should send the result of the query and the actual query: import { queryConnect } from cozy-client function TodoList ( props ) { const { data , fetchStatus } = props . result if ( fetchStatus !== loaded ) { return h1 Loading ... / h1 } else { return ul { data . map ( todo = li { todo . label } / li )} / ul } } const dest = result const todos = io.cozy.todos const checked = { checked : false } const query = ( client , props ) = client . find ( id , props . id ). where ( checked ) const queryOpts = { [ dest ] : { query } } const ConnectedTodoList = queryConnect ( queryOpts )( TodoList ) queryConnect will use Query / internally so you will inherits the same behaviour. With the same syntax, you may register multiple queries to run: import { queryConnect } from cozy-client function TodoList ( props ) { const { data , fetchStatus } = props . checked if ( fetchStatus !== loaded ) { return h1 Loading ... / h1 } else { return ul { data . map ( todo = li { todo . label } / li )} / ul } } const todos = io.cozy.todos const checked = { query : client = client . find ( todos ). where ({ checked : false }) } const archived = { query : client = client . find ( todos ). where ({ archive : false }) } const queries = { checked , archived } const ConnectedTodoList = queryConnect ( queries )( TodoList ) 3. Mutating data The simplest way is to use the withClient high order component. It will inject a client in your props with the CozyClient instance you gave to the CozyProvider / upper. import { withClient } from cozy-client function TodoList ( props ) { const { client } = props const createNewTodo = e = client . create ( io.cozy.todos , { label : e . target . elements [ new-todo ], checked : false } ) return ( ul { /* todo items */ } / ul form onSubmit = { createNewTodo } label htmlFor = new-todo Todo / label input id = new-todo name = new-todo / button type = submit Add todo / button / form ) } const ConnectedTodoList = withClient ( TodoList ) Alternatively, you have withMutation() which returns an HOC. This HOC forwards you a createDocument , a saveDocument and a deleteDocument in your props. They are the create() , save() and delete() functions from CozyClient, bound to the instance you gave to the CozyProvider / . import { withMutations } from cozy-client function TodoList ( props ) { const { createDocument } = props const createNewTodo = e = createDocument ( io.cozy.todos , { label : e . target . elements [ new-todo ], checked : false } ) return ( ul { /* todo items */ } / ul form onSubmit = { createNewTodo } label htmlFor = new-todo Todo / label input id = new-todo name = new-todo / button type = submit Add todo / button / form ) } const ConnectedTodoList = withMutations ()( TodoList ) Finally, Query / also takes a mutations optional props. It should have a function that will receive the CozyClient instance, the query requested and the rest of props given to the component, and should return a keyed object which will be added to the props of your wrapped component. import { Query } from cozy-client const todos = io.cozy.todos const checked = { checked : false } const query = client = client . find ( todos ). where ( checked ) const mutations = client = ({ createDocument : client . create . bind ( client ) }) function TodoList () { return Query query = { query } mutations = { mutations } { ({ data , fetchStatus }) = fetchStatus !== loaded ? h1 Loading ... / h1 : ul { data . map ( todo = li { todo . label } / li )} / ul } / Query }","title":"React integration"},{"location":"cozy-client/react-integration/#what-is-the-cozy-client-react-integration","text":"In addition to the Javascript client, Cozy-Client provides a way to connect directly the data from your Cozy instance to your React components.

It returns a modified Promise for the intent document, having a custom start(element) method. This method interacts with the DOM to append an iframe to the given HTML element. This iframe will provide an access to an app, which will serve a service page able to manage the intent action for the intent doctype. The start(element) method returns a promise for the result document provided by intent service. On Intent ready callback: This start method also takes a second optional argument which is a callback function ( start(element, onReadyCallback) ). When provided, this function will be run when the intent iframe will be completely loaded (using the onload iframe listener). This callback could be useful to run a client code only when the intent iframe is ready and loaded. An intent has to be created everytime an app need to perform an action over a doctype for wich it does not have permission. For example, the Cozy Drive app should create an intent to pick a io.cozy.contacts document. The cozy-stack will determines which app can offer a service to resolve the intent. It s this service s URL that will be passed to the iframe src property. Once the intent process is terminated by service, the iframe is removed from DOM.

The second optional argument transitionProperty can be used to add a CSS transition property on the intent in order to animate the resizing. js // resize the client ot 300 pixels max height service.resizeClient({ maxHeight: 300 }, '.2s linear') // will be in css - transition: .2s linear; // or service.resizeClient({ element: document.querySelector('.class') }) On intent size: If an intent is used by multiple applications, we don t use resizeClient(), since each application can have his own layout.

It s based on 1 container / user with many node.js processes in each container (cozy-data-system, cozy-proxy, cozy-home, 1 process per app). The second, thereafter named v3 is the new cozy-stack ( repository ). It s based on go and aim to support multiple user on a single process. v2 supported both server-side applications with their own node.js process and client-side applications which run in the user browser. v3 will not support server-side applications. We will support server side modules managed by server administrator, but the applications themselves will all be client-side application. This repository provides a library which allows you to build a client-side application compatible with both version. The former javascript library for making client-side application was cozy-browser-sdk . We aim to deprecate it once cozy-client-js reaches feature-parity. If you already have an application using cozy-browser-sdk , you can see what will change in the transition document . If you have any doubt, please open an issue! Include the library in your application You can import / require cozy-client-js using npm webpack. You can also copy-paste the dist/cozy-client.js bundle file into your application, and include it in your application index.html with script src=\"./cozy-client.js\" . If you are developing a client-side app for Cozy V3, you can import the lib directly from the stack, by using {{.CozyClientJS}} . Doctypes Permissions A doctype is a simple javascript string identifying a type of document. Some basic doctypes are provided by cozy, but you can pick your own. Cozy v3 expects doctypes to be qualified to ensure uniqueness. All doctypes designed by the cozy s team will be prefixed with io.cozy. , or io.cozy.labs. Any doctype you introduce is expected to be prefixed with the reverse notation of a domain you own (JLS#7.7). If you do not own a domain, you can also use a reverse notation of your email address.

The second, thereafter named v3 is the new cozy-stack ( repository ). It s based on go and aim to support multiple user on a single process. v2 supported both server-side applications with their own node.js process and client-side applications which run in the user browser. v3 will not support server-side applications. We will support server side modules managed by server administrator, but the applications themselves will all be client-side application. This repository provides a library which allows you to build a client-side application compatible with both version. The former javascript library for making client-side application was cozy-browser-sdk . We aim to deprecate it once cozy-client-js reaches feature-parity.

Before reading this document, to better understand how authentication and OAuth work on the cozy-stack, you should read this document . The library exposes internal methods to access the OAuth endpoints of the cozy-stack. See cozy.auth.* methods . However, the library also provides a more automated way to perform de OAuth flow by implementing many details of the OAuth registration and authorization flow for you. Here we describe the automated and stateful method. Storage To handle the workflow automatically, the user of the library shoud pass a storage object that will be used to store the OAuth client and tokens informations. This storage should implement the following interface : interface Storage { load ( key : string ) : Promise any save ( key : string , value : any ) : Promise any delete ( key : string ) : Promise boolean clear () : Promise } The library provides two implementation of such storage: - cozy.auth.MemoryStorage storing data in-memory - cozy.auth.LocalStorage storage data in a html5 localStorage The library constructor (on init method) should be passed the storage in the storage field of the oauth options. Registration parameters In order to handle the registration of the client, two callbacks should be provided to the cozy-client-js instance. clientParams an object with the following parameters: redirectURI : the URI on which the user is redirected after accepting the client (mandatory) softwareID : identifier of the software (by default github.com/cozy/cozy-client-js ) softwareVersion : version of the software (optional) clientName : string (optional) clientKind : string (optional) clientURI : string (optional) logoURI : string (optional) policyURI : string (optional) scopes : array of key:value elements representing the permission scopes required by the application that the user should accept (mandatory) onRegistered(client, url) which should provide the wanted side effect after the client registration and return a promise containing the request URL provided by the user containing the access code and state. The onRegistered callback is called with the registered client and the URL on which the user should go to give access to the application. Complete example for Node.JS Here is a complete example running on Node.JS with a local http server receiving as redirect URI receiving the call of the user to complete the authorization of the client. const http = require ( http ); const { Cozy , MemoryStorage } = require ( ./dist/cozy-client.node.js ) function onRegistered ( client , url ) { let server return new Promise (( resolve ) = { server = http . createServer (( request , response ) = { if ( request . url . indexOf ( /do_access ) === 0 ) { console . log ( Received access from user with url , request . url ) resolve ( request . url ) response . end () } }) server . listen ( 3333 , () = { console . log ( Please visit the following url to authorize the application: , url ) }) }) . then ( ( url ) = { server . close (); return url ; }, ( err ) = { server . close (); throw err ; } ) } const cozy = new Cozy ({ cozyURL : http://cozy.tools:8080 , oauth : { storage : new MemoryStorage (), clientParams : { redirectURI : http://localhost:3333/do_access , softwareID : foobar , clientName : client , scopes : [ io.cozy.files:GET ] }, onRegistered : onRegistered , } }) cozy . authorize (). then (( creds ) = console . log ( creds ))","title":"OAuth guide"},{"location":"cozy-client-js/oauth/#storage","text":"To handle the workflow automatically, the user of the library shoud pass a storage object that will be used to store the OAuth client and tokens informations.

Heavily inspired by artoo scraping method. scrape($, spec(s), [childSelector]) \u21d2 object | array Scrape a cheerio object for properties addData Saves the data into the cozy blindly without check. addData() \u23cf Saves the data into the cozy blindly without check. You need at least the POST permission for the given doctype in your manifest, to be able to use this function. Parameters: documents : an array of objects corresponding to the data you want to save in the cozy doctype (string): the doctype where you want to save data (ex: io.cozy.bills ) options (object): option object sourceAccount (String): id of the source account sourceAccountIdentifier (String): identifier unique to the account targetted by the connector. It is the login most of the time const documents = [ { name : toto , height : 1.8 }, { name : titi , height : 1.7 } ] return addData ( documents , io.cozy.height ) Kind : Exported function cozyClient cozy-client-js instance already initialized and ready to use. cozyClient \u23cf cozy-client-js instance already initialized and ready to use. If you want to access cozy-client-js directly, this method gives you directly an instance of it, initialized according to COZY_URL and COZY_CREDENTIALS environment variable given by cozy-stack You can refer to the cozy-client-js documentation for more information. Example : const { cozyClient } = require ( cozy-konnector-libs ) cozyClient . data . defineIndex ( my.doctype , [ _id ]) Kind : Exported constant hydrateAndFilter Filters the passed array from data already present in the cozy so that there is not duplicated data in the Cozy. hydrateAndFilter hydrateAndFilter() \u23cf ~suitableCall() hydrateAndFilter() \u23cf Filters the passed array from data already present in the cozy so that there is not duplicated data in the Cozy. You need at least the GET permission for the given doctype in your manifest, to be able to use this function. Parameters: documents : an array of objects corresponding to the data you want to save in the cozy doctype (string): the doctype where you want to save data (ex: io.cozy.bills ) options : keys (array) : List of keys used to check that two items are the same. By default it is set to `[ id ] . index (optionnal) : Return value returned by cozy.data.defineIndex , the default will correspond to all documents of the selected doctype. selector (optionnal object) : Mango request to get records. Default is built from the keys {selector: {_id: {\"$gt\": null}}} to get all the records. const documents = [ { name : toto , height : 1.8 }, { name : titi , height : 1.7 } ] return hydrateAndFilter ( documents , io.cozy.height , { keys : [ name ] }). then ( filteredDocuments = addData ( filteredDocuments , io.cozy.height )) Kind : Exported function hydrateAndFilter~suitableCall() Since we can use methods or basic functions for shouldSave and shouldUpdate we pass the appropriate this and arguments . If funcOrMethod is a method, it will be called with args[0] as this and the rest as arguments Otherwise, this will be null and args will be passed as arguments . Kind : inner method of hydrateAndFilter linkBankOperations Finds links between bills and bank operations. linkBankOperations() \u23cf Will soon move to a dedicated service. You should not use it. Finds links between bills and bank operations. Kind : Exported function mkdirp mkdirp \u23cf Creates a directory and its missing ancestors as needed. Options : ...pathComponents : one or many path components to be joined await mkdirp ( /foo ) // Creates /foo await mkdirp ( /foo ) // Does nothing as /foo already exists await mkdirp ( /bar/baz ) // Creates /bar, then /bar/baz await mkdirp ( /foo/bar/baz ) // Creates /foo/bar, then /foo/bar/baz, not /foo await mkdirp ( / ) // Does nothing await mkdirp ( /qux , qux2/qux3 , qux4 ) // Creates /qux, then /qux/qux2, // then /qux/qux2/qux3 and // finally /qux/qux2/qux3/qux4 The function will automatically add a leading slash when missing: await mkdirp ( foo , bar ) // Creates /foo, then /foo/bar Kind : Exported constant normalizeFilename Returns the given name, replacing characters that could be an issue when used in a filename with spaces. normalizeFilename() \u23cf Returns the given name, replacing characters that could be an issue when used in a filename with spaces. Replaced characters include: Those forbidden on one or many popular OS or filesystem: :\"/\\|?* Those forbidden by the cozy-stack \\0 , \\r and \\n Multiple spaces and/or tabs are replaced with a single space Leading trailing spaces and/or tabs are removed An exception will be thrown in case there is not any filename-compatible character in the given name. Parameters: basename is whatever string you want to generate the filename from ext is an optional file extension, with or without leading dot const { normalizeFilename } = require ( cozy-konnector-libs ) const filename = normalizeFilename ( *foo/bar: baz \\\\ qux \\t??? , .txt ) // `filename` === `foo bar baz qux.txt` Kind : Exported function saveBills Encapsulates the saving of Bills : saves the files, saves the new data, and associate the files to an existing bank operation saveBills() \u23cf Combines the features of saveFiles , hydrateAndFilter , addData and linkBankOperations for a common case: bills. Will create io.cozy.bills objects. The default deduplication keys are ['date', 'amount', 'vendor'] . You need the full permission on io.cozy.bills , full permission on io.cozy.files and also full permission on io.cozy.bank.operations in your manifest, to be able to use this function. Parameters: documents is an array of objects with any attributes with some mandatory attributes : amount (Number): the amount of the bill used to match bank operations date (Date): the date of the bill also used to match bank operations vendor (String): the name of the vendor associated to the bill. Ex: trainline currency (String) default: EUR: The ISO currency value (not mandatory since there is a default value. matchingCriterias (Object): criterias that can be used by an external service to match bills with bank operations. If not specified but the banksTransactionRegExp attribute is specified in the manifest of the connector, this value is automatically added to the bill You can also pass attributes expected by saveFiles : fileurl, filename, requestOptions and more Please take a look at io.cozy.bills doctype documentation - fields (object) this is the first parameter given to BaseKonnector s constructor - options is passed directly to saveFiles , hydrateAndFilter , addData and linkBankOperations . Kind : Exported function Example const { BaseKonnector , saveBills } = require ( cozy-konnector-libs ) module . exports = new BaseKonnector ( function fetch ( fields ) { const documents = [] // some code which fills documents return saveBills ( documents , fields , { identifiers : [ vendor ] }) }) saveFiles Saves the given files in the given folder via the Cozy API. saveFiles() \u23cf Saves the files given in the fileurl attribute of each entries You need the full permission on io.cozy.files in your manifest to use this function. files is an array of object with the following possible attributes : fileurl: The url of the file (can be a function returning the value). Ignored if filestream is given filestream: the stream which will be directly passed to cozyClient.files.create (can also be function returning the stream) requestOptions (object) : The options passed to request to fetch fileurl (can be a function returning the value) filename : The file name of the item written on disk. This attribute is optional and as default value, the file name will be smartly guessed by the function. Use this attribute if the guess is not smart enough for you, or if you use filestream (can be a function returning the value). shouldReplaceName (string) used to migrate filename. If saveFiles find a file linked to this entry and this file name matches shouldReplaceName , the file is renames to filename (can be a function returning the value) shouldReplaceFile (function) use this function to state if the current entry should be forced to be redownloaded and replaced. Usefull if we know the file content can change and we always want the last version. fileAttributes (object) ex: {created_at: new Date()} sets some additionnal file attributes passed to cozyClient.file.create fields (string) is the argument given to the main function of your connector by the BaseKonnector. It especially contains a folderPath which is the string path configured by the user in collect/home options (object) is optional. Possible options : timeout (timestamp) can be used if your connector needs to fetch a lot of files and if the stack does not give enough time to your connector to fetch it all. It could happen that the connector is stopped right in the middle of the download of the file and the file will be broken. With the timeout option, the saveFiles function will check if the timeout has passed right after downloading each file and then will be sure to be stopped cleanly if the timeout is not too long. And since it is really fast to check that a file has already been downloaded, on the next run of the connector, it will be able to download some more files, and so on. If you want the timeout to be in 10s, do Date.now() + 10*1000 . You can try it in the previous code. contentType (string or boolean) ex: application/pdf used to force the contentType of documents when they are badly recognized by cozy. If true the content type will be recognized from the file name and forced the same way. concurrency (number) default: 1 sets the maximum number of concurrent downloads validateFile (function) default: do not validate if file is empty or has bad mime type validateFileContent (boolean or function) default false. Also check the content of the file to recognize the mime type Kind : Exported function Example await saveFiles ([{ fileurl : https://... , filename : bill1.pdf }], fields ) saveIdentity Helper to set or merge io.cozy.identities See https://github.com/cozy/cozy-doctypes/blob/master/docs/io.cozy.identities.md saveIdentity() \u23cf Set or merge a io.cozy.identities You need full permission for the doctype io.cozy.identities in your manifest, to be able to use this function. Parameters: contact (object): the identity to create/update as an object io.cozy.contacts accountIdentifier (string): a string that represent the account use, if available fields.login options (object): options which will be given to updateOrCreate directly : sourceAccount (String): id of the source account sourceAccountIdentifier (String): identifier unique to the account targetted by the connector. It is the login most of the time const { saveIdentity } = require ( cozy-konnector-libs ) const identity = { name : toto , email : { address : toto@example.com } } return saveIdentity ( identity , fields . login ) Kind : Exported function signin Provides an handy method to log the user in, on HTML form pages. On success, it resolves to a promise with a parsed body. signin() \u23cf Provides an handy method to log the user in, on HTML form pages. On success, it resolves to a promise with a parsed body. Errors: LOGIN_FAILED if the validate predicate is false INVALID_FORM if the element matched by formSelector is not a form or has no action attribute UNKNOWN_PARSING_STRATEGY if parse is not one of the accepted values: raw , cheerio , json . VENDOR_DOWN if a request throws a RequestError, or StatusCodeError It does not submit values provided through select tags, except if populated by user with formData . url is the url to access the html form formSelector is used by cheerio to uniquely identify the form in which to log in formData is an object { name: value, \u2026 } . It is used to populate the form, in the proper inputs with the same name as the properties of this object, before submitting it. It can also be a function that returns this object. The page at url would be given as argument, right after having been parsed through cheerio . parse allow the user to resolve signin with a preparsed body. The choice of the strategy for the parsing is one of : raw , json or cheerio . cheerio being the default. validate is a predicate taking three arguments statusCode , parsedBody and fullResponse . If it is false, LOGIN_FAILED is thrown, otherwise the signin resolves with parsedBody value. requestOpts allows to pass eventual options to the signin s requestFactory . It could be useful for pages using latin1 encoding for instance. Kind : Exported function Example == basic example : == const $ = signin ({ url : `http://quotes.toscrape.com/login` , formSelector : form , formData : { username , password } }) If the behavior of the targeted website is not standard. You can pass a validate function which will allow you to: - detect if the credentials work or not - LOGIN_FAILED - detect if actions from the user are needed - USER_ACTION_NEEDED - detect if the targeted website is out - VENDOR_DOWN Example const $ = signin ({ url : `http://quotes.toscrape.com/login` , formSelector : form , formData : { username , password }, validate : ( statusCode , $ , fullResponse ) { if ( statusCode !== 200 ) return false // LOGIN_FAILED if ( $ ( .cgu ). length ) throw new Error ( USER_ACTION_NEEDED ) if ( fullResponse . request . uri . href . includes ( error )) throw new Error ( VENDOR_DOWN ) } }) Do not forget that the use of the signin function is not mandatory in a connector and won t work if the signin page does not use html forms. Here, a simple POST request may be a lot more simple. solveCaptcha Use every possible means to solve a captcha. At the moment, Anticaptcha web service is used if any related secret key is found in COZY_PARAMETERS environment variable. solveCaptcha() \u23cf Use every possible means to solve a captcha. At the moment, Anticaptcha web service is used if any related secret key is found in COZY_PARAMETERS environment variable. If you do not want to solve the captcha each time the connector is run, please also use CookieKonnector which will help you save the session. Parameters: params is an array of objects with any attributes with some mandatory attributes : type (String): (default recaptcha) type of captcha to solve. can be recaptcha or image at the moment timeout (Number): (default 3 minutes after now) time when the solver should stop trying to solve the captcha websiteKey (String): the key you can find on the targeted website (for recaptcha) websiteURL (String): The URL of the page showing the captcha (for recaptcha) body (String): The base64 encoded image (for image captcha) Returns: Promise with the solved captcha response as a string Kind : Exported function Example const { solveCaptcha } = require ( cozy-konnector-libs ) const solvedKey = await solveCaptcha ({ websiteKey : the key in the webpage , websiteURL : http://quotes.toscrape.com/login , }) // now use the solveKey to submit your form updateOrCreate Creates or updates the given entries according to if they already exist in the cozy or not updateOrCreate() \u23cf Creates or updates the given entries according to if they already exist in the cozy or not You need the full permission for the given doctype in your manifest, to be able to use this function. entries (object array): Documents to save doctype (string): Doctype of the documents matchingAttributes (string array): attributes in each entry used to check if an entry already exists in the Cozy options (object): general option affecting metadata : sourceAccount (String): id of the source account sourceAccountIdentifier (String): identifier unique to the account targetted by the connector. It is the login most of the time Kind : Exported function utils Small utilities helping to develop konnectors. utils ~fetchAll() ~queryAll() ~findDuplicates() ~batchUpdateAttributes() ~batchDelete() ~getPdfText() ~formatDate() utils~fetchAll() This function allows to fetch all documents for a given doctype. It is the fastest to get all documents but without filtering possibilities deprecated by the findAll method from cozyClient Parameters: doctype (string): the doctype from which you want to fetch the data Kind : inner method of utils utils~queryAll() This function allows to fetch all documents for a given doctype exceeding the 100 limit.

If not defined, the function will create it s own index with the keys specified in the selector const documents = await queryAll ( io.cozy.bills , { vendor : Direct Energie }) Kind : inner method of utils utils~findDuplicates() This function find duplicates in a given doctype, filtered by an optional mango selector Parameters: doctype (string): the doctype from which you want to fetch the data selector (object): (optional) the mango query selector options : keys (array) : List of keys used to check that two items are the same. index (optionnal) : Return value returned by cozy.data.defineIndex , the default will correspond to all documents of the selected doctype. selector (optionnal object) : Mango request to get records. Gets all the records by default Returns an object with the following keys: toKeep : this is the list of unique documents that you should keep in db toRemove : this is the list of documents that can remove from db. If this is io.cozy.bills documents, do not forget to clean linked bank operations const { toKeep , toRemove } = await findDuplicates ( io.cozy.bills , { selector : { vendor : Direct Energie }}) Kind : inner method of utils utils~batchUpdateAttributes() This is a shortcut to update multiple documents in one call Parameters: doctype (string): the doctype from which you want to fetch the data ids (array): array of ids of documents to update transformation (object): attributes to change with their values options : keys (array) : List of keys used to check that two items are the same. index (optionnal) : Return value returned by cozy.data.defineIndex , the default will correspond to all documents of the selected doctype. selector (optionnal object) : Mango request to get records. Gets all the records by default Returns a promise which resolves with all the return values of updateAttributes await batchUpdateAttributes ( io.cozy.bills , [ 1 , 2 , 3 ], { vendor : Direct Energie }) Kind : inner method of utils utils~batchDelete() This is a shortcut to delete multiple documents in one call Parameters: doctype (string): the doctype from which you want to fetch the data documents (array): documents to delete with their ids transformation (object): attributes to change with their values options : keys (array) : List of keys used to check that two items are the same. index (optionnal) : Return value returned by cozy.data.defineIndex , the default will correspond to all documents of the selected doctype. selector (optionnal object) : Mango request to get records.

Object categorization~createCategorizer() \u21d2 Object Initialize global and local models and return an object exposing a categorize function that applies both models on an array of transactions The global model is a model specific to hosted Cozy instances. It is not available for self-hosted instances. It will just do nothing in that case. The local model is based on the user manual categorizations. Each model adds two properties to the transactions: * The global model adds cozyCategoryId and cozyCategoryProba * The local model adds localCategoryId and localCategoryProba In the end, each transaction can have up to four different categories. An application can use these categories to show the most significant for the user. See https://github.com/cozy/cozy-doctypes/blob/master/docs/io.cozy.bank.md#categories for more informations. Kind : inner method of categorization Returns : Object - an object with a categorize method Example const { BaseKonnector , createCategorizer } = require ( cozy-konnector-libs ) class BankingKonnector extends BaseKonnector { async saveTransactions () { const transactions = await this . fetchTransactions () const categorizer = await createCategorizer const categorizedTransactions = await categorizer . categorize ( transactions ) // Save categorizedTransactions } } categorization~categorize() \u21d2 Array. Object Initialize global and local models and categorize the given array of transactions Kind : inner method of categorization Returns : Array. Object - the categorized transactions See : createCategorizer for more informations about models initialization Example const { BaseKonnector , categorize } = require ( cozy-konnector-libs ) class BankingKonnector extends BaseKonnector { async saveTransactions () { const transactions = await this . fetchTransactions () const categorizedTransactions = await categorize ( transactions ) // Save categorizedTransactions } } BaseKonnector The class from which all the connectors must inherit. It takes a fetch function in parameter that must return a Promise . You need at least the GET permission on io.cozy.accounts in your manifest to allow it to fetch account information for your connector. Kind : global class BaseKonnector new BaseKonnector(fetch) .end() .fail() .init() \u21d2 Promise .saveAccountData(data, options) \u21d2 Promise .getAccountData() \u21d2 object .updateAccountAttributes() .waitForTwoFaCode() .saveBills() \u21d2 Promise .saveFiles() \u21d2 Promise .updateOrCreate() \u21d2 Promise .saveIdentity() \u21d2 Promise .terminate(message) .getCozyMetadata(data) new BaseKonnector(fetch) Its role is twofold : Make the link between account data and konnector Handle errors \u26a0\ufe0f A promise should be returned from the fetch function otherwise the konnector cannot know that asynchronous code has been called. this.terminate( LOGIN_FAILED ) Param Type Description fetch function Function to be run automatically after account data is fetched. This function will be binded to the current connector. If not fetch function is given. The connector will have to handle itself it s own exection and error handling Example const { BaseKonnector } = require ( cozy-konnector-libs ) module . exports = new BaseKonnector ( function fetch () { // use this to access the instance of the konnector to // store any information that needs to be passed to // different stages of the konnector return request ( http://ameli.fr ) . then ( computeReimbursements ) . then ( saveBills ) }) baseKonnector.end() Hook called when the connector is ended Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector baseKonnector.fail() Hook called when the connector fails Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector baseKonnector.init() \u21d2 Promise Initializes the current connector with data coming from the associated account Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector Returns : Promise - with the fields as an object baseKonnector.saveAccountData(data, options) \u21d2 Promise Saves data to the account that is passed to the konnector. Use it to persist data that needs to be passed to each konnector run. By default, the data is merged to the remote data, use options.merge = false to overwrite the data. The data is saved under the .data attribute of the cozy account. Don t forget to modify the manifest.konnector file to give the right to write on the io.cozy.accounts doctype. The syntax can be : \"permissions\": {\"accounts\": {\"type\": \"io.cozy.accounts\"}} (here we juste removed the verb GET ) Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector Returns : Promise - : resolved with the modified account Param Type Description data object Attributes to be merged options object { merge: true baseKonnector.getAccountData() \u21d2 object Get the data saved by saveAccountData Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector baseKonnector.updateAccountAttributes() Update account attributes and cache the account Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector baseKonnector.waitForTwoFaCode() Notices that 2FA code is needed and wait for the user to submit it. It uses the account to do the communication with the user Parameters: params object with some mandatory attributes : type (String): (default email) this is the type of expected 2FA code.

The files are saved in the root directory of your cozy by default. How does the cozy-stack run the connector ? The cozy-stack runs the connector in a nsjail container to be sure it does not affect the environment. The connector is run by calling yarn start with the following envrionment variables : COZY_CREDENTIALS needs to be the result of cozy-stack instances token-cli instance name scope COZY_URL is the full http or https url to your cozy COZY_FIELDS is something like : { data : { attributes : { arguments : { account : cf31eaef5d899404a7e8c3737c1c2d1f , folder_to_save : folderPathId , slug : mykonnector } } } } The account field is the id of the record with doctype io.cozy.accounts which will be used as parameters for your konnector. Build (without Travis) To be able to run the connector, the cozy stack needs a connector which is built into only one file, without needing to install its dependencies, this will be a lot faster to install. There is a command in package.json to help you to do that : yarn build This command uses [webpack] to bundle all the code needed by your connector into one file. This will generate an index.js file in the build directory and add all files the connector will need. You can deploy this build by using the specific script : yarn deploy This command will commit and push your build in the branch build fo your project. And your konnector can now be installed using the following url : git://github.com/konnectors/cozy-konnector- .git#build Build using Travis CI This project contains a .travis.yml config file which allows you to build your connector automatically using [Travis-CI][travis]. You can follow these steps to enable building using Travis: On your [travis-ci.org][travis] account, find your project name (should be the same than your Github repository) and enable Travis by using the related checkbox. Once enabled, go to this project on Travis by clicking on it and go to the Settings menu by using the More options menu at the top right. Enable these three options: Build only if .travis.yml is present Build branch updates (run Travis after each branch update) Build pull request updates (run Travis after each Pull Request update) Then, you have to generate a Github token in your Github account settings .

This process has at least two major flows : We are always synchronizing all the data provided by the external service. When something is modified (for example, the name of the stored file, it s almost sure that the previous one will be kept and that we ll have a duplicate) Another side effect could be that in a very large set of documents to synchronize, the whole process may take more than 3 minutes and never synchronize documents at the end of the list. Current usage When saving bills, cozy-konnector-libs provides a filtering and hydratation mechanism, to avoid overriding existing bills. It is done in function hydrateAndFilters . This method performs two actions : hydrate entries retrieved from service with usable data from couchDB (like existing bill id) filter entries retrieved from service and return only entries that need to be saved/synchronized. Objectives of this document The goals of this document are: Define a common way to store synchronization data for all konnector Propose a naive implementation for an abstract synchronisation data storing mechanism, provided by cozy-konnector-libs Propose a solution to synchronize every type of data or file, not only bills Taking the hydrateAndFilter function as basis, split it in three functions performing the following tasks : actual filtering, synchronization data hydratation and saving/updating current database document with correspondig external entries (the part done by the actual hydratation ) Storing synchronization data in documents Before saving any data or file, we will add in the relying document every synchronization data we will need. The added data will depend on how the service the konnector connects to retrieve entries and which information they gave us. Simple case, by id We suppose that in the most cases, we will face to entries provinding their own id attribute. The idea is to store it as synchronization data to be able to easily retrieve them later. To store synchronization data, we are using a sync attribute in document metadata attribute. Example: { metadata : { sync : { id : 7ee401e841c94159addb47f190903139 , konnector : trainline , last_sync : Mon, 12 Feb 2018 16:25:34 GMT } } } The expected information to be save is: field role id The id of the document, but given by the external service. If the external service does not provide any id or uuid, it could be interesting to generate one, with an hash of the file for example. konnector The slug of the konnector (Example: trainline , freemobile , cic ). This could be very useful to retrieve data synchronized with this konnector. last_sync Date of last synchronization, set to now() when storage is made. By multiple attributes If the external service does not provide any id attribute, we may need to use instead a list of attributes, for example firstname , lastname , dateofbirth . { metadata : { sync : { firstname : Claude , lastname : Causi , dateofbirth : 06/12/1980 } } } As we cannot be sure that we will have different data, it could be better to use a custom way of providing an unique identifier. By custom method When the external service does not provide any identifier, we have to use a custom method to generate one. It could be for example the filename or a hash generated with the document content. { metadata : { sync : { id: : customhash34FED5465645ABF54656FCB } } } Saving document based on synchronization strategy To solve the synchronization process we need to: be able to add synchronization data on any type of document be able to compare external entries to current database state * provide a default implementation while letting the contributors to define their own ones Adding synchronization data We should provide an addSyncData function could, which look like this (naive implementation, this piece of code needs to be improved to handle cases where synchronizationStrategy.idAttribute is an array or a function): const addSyncData = ( document , entry , synchronizationStrategy ) = { return { ... document , metadata : { ... document . metadata , id : entry [ synchronizationStrategy . idAttribute ] } } ```` Where `document` is the future document to save , `entry` the corresponding external entry , and `synchronizationStrategy` and object defining the synchronization properties and methods ( see below ). ### Filtering entries Now we have saved our documents in database with consistent synchronization metadata , we need to provide a way to filter external entries . We should provide a `filterEntriesToSynchronize` which returns a list of entries with new data or data to update . As `addSyncData` , this method will receive a `synchronizationStrategy` . The filtering algorithm should be based on the returned value of `synchronizationStrategy.shouldSave` and `synchronizationStrategy.shouldUpdate` . \u26a0\ufe0f As the `synchronizationStrategy.shouldSave` and `synchronizationStrategy.shouldUpdate` will be asynchronous methods , `filterEntriesToSynchronize` should also be asynchronous . A naive example of `filterEntriesToSynchronize` implementation should be : ```js const filterEntriesToSynchronize = async (cozy, entries, synchronizationStrategy) = { const filtered = [] entries.forEach(entry = { // getExistingSynchronizedDocument needs to be implemented, it should retrieve // existing document from database, based on synchronization data. const existingDocument = cozy.getExistingSynchronizedDocument(entry, synchronizationStrategy) const toSave = await synchronizationStrategy.shouldSave(entry, existingDocument) const toUpdate = await synchronizationStrategy.shouldUpdate(entry, existingDocument) if (toSave || toUpdate) filtered.push(entry) }) return filtered } Synchronization strategy For our functions or methods dealing with synchronization, we pass a synchronizationStrategy object. Internally, we will use a default one but let the ability to contributors to pass their own ones. It is a simple object containing the following properties: Option Role disableSyncData (boolean) Disable storage of synchronization data. Default: false findLegacyDocument (function) Custom function which a konnector may use to look for a legacy document. Default is null . See below for more details. getSyncData (function) A mapping method returning additional synchronization data which have to be added to the document. idAttribute (string Array function) How the identifier attribute is named in the entry. Default value: id . See below for additional customization konnector Mandatory (string) The slug (or better, an uuid) of the current konnector. shouldSave (function) A method taking current entry and matching document in database to evaluate if an entry has to be saved in database. See below default method and customization. shouldUpdate (function) A method taking current entry and matching document in database to evaluate if a document must be updated with current entry. See below for default method and customization. findLegacyDocument If a document has not been saved yet with actual synchronization data, we will have no way to retrieve it, except by providing a findLegacyDocument function to saveEntry options. This signature of a findLegacyDocument function is: async function ( entry , cozy ) = { /* look for your document */ } ```` The `cozy` parameter is an instance of Cozy - Client . The idea is for example to retrive a document by its file path or any other accurate information . ### getSyncData This method returns any addtional synchronization data the konnector should need . Default method should be something returning an empty object or `null` . ```js (entry) = ({}) A konnector should provide its own method: { getSyncData : ( entry ) = ({ filename : entry . name }) } ``` ### idAttribute #### String Name of the id attribute in entry. Default is ` id `. If we want to use another name, we may use: ``` js saveFiles ( files , { idAttribute : uuid }) Array This attribute may also be an array of string, defining each entry attribute which must be used for identifier. Example saveFiles ( files , { idAttribute : [ name , author , date ]}) In this case, all fields are used in synchronization data. function When an entry does not provide an unique identifer, it is possible to use a function as idAttribute to customize the way the unique identifer is generated. Example addData ( file , { idAttribute : ( entry ) = hash ( entry )}) // hash() is a custom method hashing the current file. konnector The konnector attribute is used as a key reference to retrieve all document synchronized by this konnector. For now, the konnector option will be needed for every call. But it could be interesting to initialize some kind of runner with it, which may encapsulate all the cozy-konnector-libs functions. shouldSave The shouldSave function returns a boolean which indicate if the entry should be saved. The default method should be: async function shouldSave ( entry , existingDocument , cozy ) = { return Promise . resolve ( ! existingDocument ) } When calling this function, it is assumed that cozy-konnector-libs first queries the database for an exisring document, based on synchronization data and pass the document resulting the query to the shouldSave function, event if this document is null . We pass the whole document, and not only synchronization data, to let the contributors free on their way they are determining it a document should be saved. As a third parameter, a cozyClient instance is passed, it may be used by a konnector to perform another query. Because of this third parameter, the whole shouldSave method is asynchronous. shouldUpdate The shouldUpdate function acts exactly like shouldSave , except that it is used to determine if a document should be updated. By default, we make the choice to never update a document (except if it does not have synchronization data, see findLegacyDocument above). But some konnectors like Linxo related ones need to update existing documents. The default method is: async function shouldUpdate ( entry , existingDocument , cozy ) { // Update an existing document only if it does not have synchronization data const hasSyncData = !! existingDocument !! existingDocument . metadata !! existingDocument . metadata . sync return Promise . resolve ( ! hasSyncData ) } ```` ## Whole example As the way data are saved from `cozy-konnector-libs` differs based on data type , we let the saving mechanism to others functions or methods . For example , in existing codebase , bills are saved in a specific way , resulting in two documents in database . However , we could provide top - level functions or methods , like `synchronizeBills` or a more generic `synchronizeData` . Here is a whole and naive example of how `synchronizeBills` could be implemebted : ```js const synchronizeBills = async (cozy, entries, synchronizationStrategy) = { return await filteredEntries = await filterEntriesToSynchronize(cozy, entries, synchronizationStrategy) .then(filteredEntries = filteredEntries.map(entry = addSyncData(entry, synchronizationStrategy))) // existing saveBills method (with maybe some little changes) .saveBills(synchronizedDocuments) } Usage could be: synchronizeBills(cozy, entries, { findLegacyDocument: (entry, cozy) = { return cozy.files.statByPath(getEntryPath(entry)) }, getSyncData: (file) = ({ fileName: file.name }), idAttribute: uuid , konnector: myservice , shouldSave: (file) = { // For whatever reason we only save files created after 2010 return Promise.resolve(moment(file.creationDate).year().isAfter(2010)) }, shouldUpdate: (file, existingDocument) = { const hasBeenModified = moment(file.modificationDate).isAfter(existingDocument.metadata.sync.last_sync) return Promise.resolve(hasBeenModified) } }) Every synchronized document will contain: { metadata : { sync : { konnector : myservice , id : entry_id , last_sync : now , fileName : fileName } } }","title":"Synchronization"},{"location":"cozy-konnector-libs/synchronization/#table-of-contents","text":"Konnector synchronisation data and options Problems Current usage Objectives of this document Storing synchronization data in documents Simple case, by id By multiple attributes By custom method Saving document based on synchronization strategy Adding synchronization data Filtering entries Synchronization strategy findLegacyDocument getSyncData Array Example function Example konnector shouldSave shouldUpdate Whole example","title":"Table of contents"},{"location":"cozy-konnector-libs/synchronization/#konnector-synchronisation-data-and-options","text":"","title":"Konnector synchronisation data and options"},{"location":"cozy-konnector-libs/synchronization/#problems","text":"Except bank konnectors which are already solving the addressed problem, all konnectors are currently processing data they are collecting in the same way: Get all data to synchronize Store it in CouchDB, even if it means overriding previously synchronized data.

The default method should be: async function shouldSave ( entry , existingDocument , cozy ) = { return Promise . resolve ( ! existingDocument ) } When calling this function, it is assumed that cozy-konnector-libs first queries the database for an exisring document, based on synchronization data and pass the document resulting the query to the shouldSave function, event if this document is null . We pass the whole document, and not only synchronization data, to let the contributors free on their way they are determining it a document should be saved. As a third parameter, a cozyClient instance is passed, it may be used by a konnector to perform another query. Because of this third parameter, the whole shouldSave method is asynchronous.","title":"shouldSave"},{"location":"cozy-konnector-libs/synchronization/#shouldupdate","text":"The shouldUpdate function acts exactly like shouldSave , except that it is used to determine if a document should be updated. By default, we make the choice to never update a document (except if it does not have synchronization data, see findLegacyDocument above). But some konnectors like Linxo related ones need to update existing documents. The default method is: async function shouldUpdate ( entry , existingDocument , cozy ) { // Update an existing document only if it does not have synchronization data const hasSyncData = !! existingDocument !! existingDocument . metadata !! existingDocument . metadata . sync return Promise . resolve ( ! hasSyncData ) } ```` ## Whole example As the way data are saved from `cozy-konnector-libs` differs based on data type , we let the saving mechanism to others functions or methods . For example , in existing codebase , bills are saved in a specific way , resulting in two documents in database . However , we could provide top - level functions or methods , like `synchronizeBills` or a more generic `synchronizeData` . Here is a whole and naive example of how `synchronizeBills` could be implemebted : ```js const synchronizeBills = async (cozy, entries, synchronizationStrategy) = { return await filteredEntries = await filterEntriesToSynchronize(cozy, entries, synchronizationStrategy) .then(filteredEntries = filteredEntries.map(entry = addSyncData(entry, synchronizationStrategy))) // existing saveBills method (with maybe some little changes) .saveBills(synchronizedDocuments) } Usage could be: synchronizeBills(cozy, entries, { findLegacyDocument: (entry, cozy) = { return cozy.files.statByPath(getEntryPath(entry)) }, getSyncData: (file) = ({ fileName: file.name }), idAttribute: uuid , konnector: myservice , shouldSave: (file) = { // For whatever reason we only save files created after 2010 return Promise.resolve(moment(file.creationDate).year().isAfter(2010)) }, shouldUpdate: (file, existingDocument) = { const hasBeenModified = moment(file.modificationDate).isAfter(existingDocument.metadata.sync.last_sync) return Promise.resolve(hasBeenModified) } }) Every synchronized document will contain: { metadata : { sync : { konnector : myservice , id : entry_id , last_sync : now , fileName : fileName } } }","title":"shouldUpdate"},{"location":"cozy-konnector-libs/migrations/v2-to-v3/","text":"Migrating from v2 to v3 Oviously, start by upgrading the cozy-konnector-libs package. $ yarn upgrade cozy-konnector-libs --save Deprecated attributes Following konnector s attributes may be removed, as they are not used anymore: color name models category dataType customView Removed models The following models has been removed and code using them has to be adapted: * Bill Removed methods The following methods has been removed from codebase: filterExisting linkBankOperation saveFiles filterData * addDataandlinkBankOperation These ones have been directly encapsulated into saveBills Konnector instanciation To instanciate a konnector, juste instanciate a new BaseKonnector with a fetch method as parameter.

webpack.target.mobile.js Miscellaneous webpack.vars.js Introduction To build a Cozy application, cozy-scripts uses webpack under the hood, and this documentation is dedicated to all webpack configuration files. In order to organize all these webpack configurations, they are classified in many files according to the concern. Having many unit files for the configuration will also allow to support specific application needs without ejecting (removing cozy-scripts dependency and copy all webpack configurations and dependencies to the application repository). These files are supposed to be enoughly independant to be usable upon request as far as possible without conflicts. Kind of config file: Bundle: A bundle regroup many unit configuration for a specific use case like the default React application or an VueJS application. Environment: An environment config is in charge of provided variables and pluging specific to a compiling context (development or production for example). Target: A target means the one which will use the built. For now we only have to targets, browser for the default web application and mobile for the native mobile application using Cordova (in progress). Bundles webpack.bundle.default.js This file is the default config bundle used for the application built from cozy-scripts . It uses all following configs files: - webpack.config.base.js - webpack.config.chunks.js - webpack.config.cozy-ui.js - webpack.config.cozy-ui.react.js - webpack.config.eslint.js - webpack.config.intents.js - webpack.config.manifest.js - webpack.config.pictures.js - webpack.config.progress.js - webpack.config.react.js - webpack.config.vendors.js - webpack.environment.dev.js - webpack.environment.prod.js - webpack.target.browser.js - webpack.target.mobile.js - webpack.vars.js By default cozy-scripts uses this bundle in an opinionated way, but you can overload this configuration by creating a custom app.config.js in your application root directory: // app.config.js // using ES Modules import configs from cozy-scripts/config/webpack.bundle.default.js import myConfig from ./config/webpack.myconfig.js // or using CommonJS const configs = require ( cozy-scripts/config/webpack.bundle.default.js ) const myConfig = require ( ./config/webpack.myconfig.js ) // it s possible to add many custom configurations using this way, // the last will overwrite the previous in case of conflicts module . exports = [ configs , myConfig ] webpack.bundle.preact.js This file is the same default bundle but using preact instead (previous default config bundle used for the application built from cozy-scripts ). It uses all following configs files: - webpack.config.base.js - webpack.config.chunks.js - webpack.config.cozy-ui.js - webpack.config.cozy-ui.react.js - webpack.config.eslint.js - webpack.config.intents.js - webpack.config.manifest.js - webpack.config.pictures.js - webpack.config.preact.js - webpack.config.progress.js - webpack.config.vendors.js - webpack.environment.dev.js - webpack.environment.prod.js - webpack.target.browser.js - webpack.target.mobile.js - webpack.vars.js This config will replace react usage by preact-compat in a transparent manner (webpack aliases). The app.config.js is needed to use this bundle since it s not the default one for cozy-scripts . But you can still overload it using a custom config like the default bundle: // app.config.js // using ES Modules import configs from cozy-scripts/config/webpack.bundle.preact.js import myConfig from ./config/webpack.myconfig.js // or using CommonJS const configs = require ( cozy-scripts/config/webpack.bundle.preact.js ) const myConfig = require ( ./config/webpack.myconfig.js ) // it s possible to add many custom configurations using this way, // the last will overwrite the previous in case of conflicts module . exports = [ configs , myConfig ] webpack.bundle.vue.js This file is the VueJS config bundle used for the application built from cozy-scripts with the option --vue . It uses all following configs files: - webpack.config.base.js - webpack.config.chunks.js - webpack.config.cozy-ui.js - webpack.config.eslint.js - webpack.config.intents.js - webpack.config.manifest.js - webpack.config.pictures.js - webpack.config.progress.js - webpack.config.vendors.js - webpack.config.vue.js - webpack.environment.dev.js - webpack.environment.prod.js - webpack.target.browser.js - webpack.target.mobile.js - webpack.vars.js You can still overload it using a custom config like the default bundle using the app.config.js file: // app.config.js // ES Modules import configs from cozy-scripts/config/webpack.bundle.vue.js import myConfig from ./config/webpack.myconfig.js // or CommonJS const configs = require ( cozy-scripts/config/webpack.bundle.vue.js ) const myConfig = require ( ./config/webpack.myconfig.js ) // it s possible to add many custom configurations using this way, // the last will overwrite the previous in case of conflicts module . exports = [ configs , myConfig ] Unit Configs webpack.config.analyzer.js This file will only add the plugin webpack-bundle-analyzer to be run on with the --analyzer option. It will run a server (on port 8889 to not be in conflict with the webpack dev server) and open an interactive treemap visualization of the contents of all your bundles in your browser. webpack.config.base.js The default basic configuration of the application. Properties output to [name].js filename resolve: modules to ['node_modules', 'src'] extensions: .js , .json and .css Rules all .js (excluding node_modules , cozy-bar and cozy-client-js ) to be loaded using babel-loader (with cacheDirectory option for caching in node_modules/.cache/babel-loader ) all .css to be loaded using options: mini-css-extract-plugin extractor loader by default or style-loader for hot reloading css-loader with sourceMap postcss-loader to optimize css output code with sourceMap and autoprefixer plugin to { browsers: ['last 2 versions'] } A specific noParse property is enabled on /localforage/dist . Plugins: postcss-assets-webpack-plugin (logs from this plugin are shown only in --debug mode) to load all .css files with: css-mqpacker (pack all CSS media query rules into one) postcss-discard-duplicates (remove duplicates) postcss-discard-empty (remove empty definitions) csswring only in production environment to minify and remove comments ( preservehacks enabled) webpack.config.chunks.js This configuration will use the optimization property with splitChunks in order to split the build into two chunks: - The main one, it can be app or intents - And the vendors chunk which will gather all stuff from node_modules Splitting chunks allow to decrease the size of the main chunk and optimize the build for caching (mainly the main chunk will change during development). webpack.config.cozy-ui.js This configuration will allow to load styles from cozy-ui . It adds a rule for all .styl files excluding node_modules and node_modules/cozy-ui/react to be loaded using: - mini-css-extract-plugin extractor loader by default or style-loader for hot reloading - css-loader with sourceMap - postcss-loader to optimize css output code with sourceMap and autoprefixer plugin to { browsers: ['last 2 versions'] } - stylus-loader using the custom stylus plugin from cozy-ui as option It also uses svg-sprite-loader/plugin to merge the built svg sprite from cozy-ui into the application s one webpack.config.cozy-ui.react.js This configuration is specific to react components usage from cozy-ui , since they currently need css-modules . This configuration file could be removed if this cozy-ui requirement disappear. It adds a rule for all .styl files from cozy-ui/react to be loaded using: - mini-css-extract-plugin extractor loader by default or style-loader for hot reloading - css-loader with modules , sourceMap and [local]--[hash:base64:5] as localIdentName - postcss-loader to optimize css output code with sourceMap and autoprefixer plugin to { browsers: ['last 2 versions'] } - stylus-loader using the custom stylus plugin from cozy-ui as option webpack.config.css-modules.js This configuration will allow to use css-modules with stylus files. To overload previous stylus loaders, it uses the following webpack-merge smartStrategy : { 'modules.loaders': 'replace' } . It adds a rule for all .styl files excluding node_modules and node_modules/cozy-ui/react to be loaded using: - mini-css-extract-plugin extractor loader by default or style-loader for hot reloading - css-loader with modules , sourceMap and [local]--[hash:base64:5] as localIdentName - postcss-loader to optimize css output code with sourceMap and autoprefixer plugin to { browsers: ['last 2 versions'] } - stylus-loader webpack.config.eslint.js A rule to preload all .js/.jsx files with eslint-loader (excluding node_modules ) extending babel-preset-cozy-app The emitWarning option is set to true for production environment or if hot reload is enabled to force emitting warning and to avoid errors breaking the build. webpack.config.intents.js This is a specific configuration file to develop application intents for the Cozy platform. It will: - add a webpack entry: the babel-polyfill import and the src/targets/intents/intents.jsx file - use html-webpack-plugin configured to use index.ejs HTML template from src/targets/intents/ with options: - title : name property of the package.json + intents - filename : intents/index.html , the output file - excludeChunks : to exclude chunk app - inject to false - minify with collapseWhitespace to true webpack.config.hash.js A custom webpack plugin usage to extract the hash from built files for reference. webpack.config.manifest.js A copy-webpack-plugin plugin usage to copy the manifest.webapp , README.md and LICENSE files to the output build folder. In the production environment, the manifest.webapp is transformed to include locales from the application src/locales folder (locales concerning manifest descriptions, permissions, names ). It will look for the manifest property (if found) of the locale .json file. So the locales property of the manifest.webapp will be an object of language slugs as properties and each slug matching the related locales found. The langs array in the manifest will also be computed according to the languages found in src/locales . Except for production environment, the manifest.webapp is transformed using a custom function to change the slug property value to app (to keep using app.cozy.tools:8080 URL for different app development). webpack.config.pictures.js This configuration will handle all pictures files. It will add two rules: - all .svg files in sprites/ and icons/ folders will be loaded using svg-sprite-loader with output name to [name]_[hash] . This loader will merge all SVG content to one .svg file and replace their reference to the matching id . Only one .svg sprite file will be loaded by the ouput application. - all other .svg , .png , .gif , .jpg , .jpeg files will be loaded using file-loader with options: - path to img , the ouput folder - symbolId to [name].[hash].[ext] for production environment, [name].[ext] for other environments It also adds svg-sprite-loader/plugin as plugin to use it with the related loader. webpack.config.preact.js A config to resolve all react aliases using Preact instead. It will: - resolve .jsx extensions - add aliases: - react to preact-compat - react-dom to preact-compat - Due to an HMR issue , preact-compat to preact-compat/dist/preact-compat - add a rule for .jsx files excluding node_modules (exception for node_modules/cozy-ui ) to be loaded using babel-loader (with cacheDirectory option for caching in node_modules/.cache/babel-loader ) webpack.config.progress.js This config will just add a custom webpack plugin to display a progress bar when webpack building/watching. It internally uses the included webpack plugin webpack.ProgressPlugin . webpack.config.services.js This config will provide a separate config to build app services using Webpack multi-compiling . In this case, all services files ( .js files in the /src/targets/services/ folder) will be built using this separate webpack config. This config will: - use __mergeStrategy to drive the webpack-merge strategy : - disable smart merging - use the replace mode plugins , output , entry , optimization and module - define as webpack entry an array of all .js files contained in /src/target/services folder - use as output the /build/services folder with [name].js as filename - define the target as 'node' - disable devtool (boolean to false ) - define the global variable __TARGET__ to services using the plugin webpack.DefinePlugin This config will be used only if the webpack target is browser . webpack.config.react.js A config to load .jsx using for React components. It will: - resolve .jsx extensions - add a rule for .jsx files excluding node_modules (exception for node_modules/cozy-ui ) to be loaded using babel-loader (with cacheDirectory option for caching in node_modules/.cache/babel-loader ) webpack.config.vendors.js A copy-webpack-plugin plugin usage to copy all files from the vendors/assets/ folder to the output build folder. This config will also process the application icon and run svgo to optimize it if this is a SVG file. webpack.config.vue.js A config to use the VueJS (v2+) framework. It will: - resolve .vue extensions - add a rule for .vue files, excluding node_modules , to be loaded using vue-loader . Environments webpack.environment.dev.js Properties devtool to #source-map externals with ['cozy'] to exclude all cozy.* dependencies from the output bundle (since it will be serve by ProvidePlugin ) mode to development Plugins: webpack.DefinePlugin to define globals variables at compiling time: __DEVELOPMENT__ to true __STACK_ASSETS__ to false webpack.ProvidePlugin to provide cozy-bar and cozy-client-js from node_modules (in production, these modules will be provided to the application by the cozy-stack ) Copy ( copy-webpack-plugin ) the cozy-bar.css file from node_modules ot the app build to be able to develop on the cozy-bar using the app Add the cozy-bar css to the main html file via html-webpack-include-assets-plugin Only in the hot reload mode: - webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin which allows all kinds of modules to be updated at runtime without the need for a full refresh - write-file-webpack-plugin to write all the build file from webpack-dev-server to the disk (necessary for the hot-reloading) webpack.environment.prod.js Plugins: webpack.optimize.OccurrenceOrderPlugin webpack.DefinePlugin to define globals variables at compiling time: process.env.NODE_ENV to production __DEVELOPMENT__ to false __DEVTOOLS__ to false __STACK_ASSETS__ to true if target different from mobile In this production mode, webpack will automatically use the Terser plugin to optimize the build (with parallel: true to speedup the build). Targets webpack.target.browser.js Properties entry : the babel-polyfill import and the index.jsx from src/targets/browser/ output : build/ path with filename to [name].js and pathinfo enabling only with the COZY_SCRIPTS_DEBUG mode externals with { 'cozy-client-js': 'cozy' } to exclude cozy-client-js (via cozy.* ) dependency from the output bundle Plugins: html-webpack-plugin configured to use index.ejs HTML template from src/targets/browser/ with options: title : name property of the package.json inject to false excludeChunks : to exclude chunk intents minify with collapseWhitespace to true webpack.DefinePlugin to define globals variables at compile time: __TARGET__ to browser webpack.target.mobile.js Properties entry : the babel-polyfill import and the index.jsx from src/targets/mobile output : src/targets/mobile/www path and pathinfo enabling only with the COZY_SCRIPTS_DEBUG mode Plugins: html-webpack-plugin configured to use index.ejs HTML template from src/targets/mobile/ with options: title : name property of the package.json excludeChunks : to exclude chunk intents minify with collapseWhitespace to true webpack.DefinePlugin to define globals variables at compile time: __ALLOW_HTTP__ to false if production environment, true for other environments __TARGET__ to mobile __APP_VERSION__ to the version property of the package.json webpack.ProvidePlugin to provide cozy-bar and cozy-client-js from node_modules (since it s for the native application, it s not served by the cozy-stack unlike the browser version) Miscellaneous webpack.vars.js This file is used to get webpack variables. They are necessary to build correctly the application. It will export these following variables: - addAnalyzer according to the COZY_SCRIPTS_ANALYZER environment variable (used to get the webpack-bundle-analyze usage) - environment according to NODE_ENV environment variable ( target:environment ) - getCSSLoader , a function returing the correctly style lodaer to use ( mini-css-extract-plugin loader by default and style-loader for hot reloading) - isDebugMode according to the COZY_SCRIPTS_DEBUG environment variable (used to get into a debug mode of cozy-scripts ) - target according to NODE_ENV environment variable ( target:environment ) - useHotReload according to the HOT_RELOAD environment variable to use hot reloading feature or not If no environment variable NODE_ENV is found, it will be browser:development by default.","title":"The `cozy-scripts` Webpack configurations"},{"location":"cozy-scripts/webpack-configs/#the-cozy-scripts-webpack-configurations","text":"","title":"The cozy-scripts Webpack configurations"},{"location":"cozy-scripts/webpack-configs/#table-of-content","text":"Introduction Bundles webpack.bundle.default.js webpack.bundle.preact.js webpack.bundle.vue.js Unit Configs webpack.config.analyzer.js webpack.config.base.js webpack.config.chunks.js webpack.config.cozy-ui.js webpack.config.cozy-ui.react.js webpack.config.css-modules.js webpack.config.eslint.js webpack.config.hash.js webpack.config.intents.js webpack.config.manifest.js webpack.config.pictures.js webpack.config.preact.js webpack.config.progress.js webpack.config.react.js webpack.config.services.js webpack.config.vendors.js webpack.config.vue.js Environments webpack.environment.dev.js webpack.environment.prod.js Targets webpack.target.browser.js webpack.target.mobile.js Miscellaneous webpack.vars.js","title":"Table of content"},{"location":"cozy-scripts/webpack-configs/#introduction","text":"To build a Cozy application, cozy-scripts uses webpack under the hood, and this documentation is dedicated to all webpack configuration files.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Cozy! There are many ways to contribute, and we appreciate all of them. Security Issues If you discover a security issue, please bring it to their attention right away! Please DO NOT file a public issue, instead send your report privately to security AT cozycloud DOT cc. Security reports are greatly appreciated and we will publicly thank you for it. We currently do not offer a paid security bounty program, but are not ruling it out in the future. Bug Reports While bugs are unfortunate, they re a reality in software. We can t fix what we don t know about, so please report liberally. If you re not sure if something is a bug or not, feel free to file a bug anyway. Opening an issue is as easy as following this link and filling out the fields. Here are some things you can write about your bug: A short summary What did you try, step by step? What did you expect? What did happen instead? What is the version of the Cozy Stack? You can also use the cozy-stack bug command to open the form to report issue prefilled with some useful system informations. Pull Requests Workflow Pull requests are the primary mechanism we use to change Cozy. GitHub itself has some great documentation on using the Pull Request feature. We use the fork and pull model described there. Step 1: Fork Fork the project on GitHub and check out your copy locally: \u26a0\ufe0f Be sure to clone outside the $GOPATH otherwise gomodules will not work (or use the GO111MODULE=on env variable to force the usage of go modules). $ git clone https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack.git $ cd cozy-stack $ git remote add fork git://github.com/username/cozy-stack.git Step 2: Branch Create a branch and start hacking: $ git checkout -b my-branch -t origin/master Step 3: Code Well, I think you know how to do that. Just be sure to follow the coding guidelines from the Go community (gofmt, Effective Go , comment the code, etc.). We are using goimports to format code, and golangci-lint to detect code smells. We are using eslint to lint JavaScript code. The linting rules are based on cozy-app Step 4: Test Don t forget to add tests and be sure they are green: $ go test -v ./... If you want to play with the modified cozy-stack (for example, testing it with a webapp), you can build it locally and start it with this command: $ go build ./cozy-stack serve Step 5: Commit Writing good commit messages is important. A commit message should describe what changed and why. Step 6: Rebase Use git pull --rebase , or git rebase (but not git merge ), to sync your work from time to time: $ git pull origin master --rebase Step 7: Push $ git push fork my-branch Go to https://github.com/username/cozy-stack and select your branch. Click the Pull Request button and fill out the form. Pull requests are usually reviewed within a few days. If there are comments to address, apply your changes in a separate commit and push that to your branch. Code organization The codebase of cozy-stack contains several packages, and it is quite easy to have circular import issues in go. To limit the risk, we have split the packages in several directories with some rules for the imports. In short, a package in this list should import other packages that are on the same line or below: main and cmd are the top level packages web is where we have the routers and handlers for web requests worker is where we define the workers for our job system model is for high-level internal packages (in general one package is used for one doctype) client is a small number of packages used for writing clients for the stack pkg is the low-level packages (most of those packages are just a couple of structs and functions). Note that tests/testutils can be used safely in web and worker packages. In model , it can be used but it is recommended to use a fake package for the tests if it is the case. For example, model/oauth/client_test.go is declared as package oauth_test . External assets The cozy-stack serve some assets for the client application. In particular, cozy-client-js and cozy-bar assets are listed in assets/external . To update them, you can open a pull request for this file. When a maintainer will accept this pull request, he will also run scripts/build.sh assets to transform them in go code (to make the repository go gettable). Useful commands There are some useful commands to know in order to develop with the go code of cozy-stack: cd cozy-stack go build # Build the stack, also takes care of updating dependencies through gomodules go install # Installs the `cozy-stack` binary go test -v ./... # To launch the tests go run main.go serve # To start the API server godoc -http = :6060 # To start the documentation server # Open http://127.0.0.1:6060/pkg/github.com/cozy/cozy-stack/ Writing documentation Documentation improvements are very welcome. We try to keep a good documentation in the docs/ folder. But, you know, we are developers, we can forget to document important stuff that look obvious to us. And documentation can always be improved. Translations The Cozy Stack is translated on a platform called Transifex . This tutorial can help you to learn how to make your first steps here. If you have any question, don t hesitate to ask us! The translations are imported from transifex with tx pull -a in the assets/locales directory, and packed in the go code with scripts/build.sh assets . Community You can help us by making our community even more vibrant.

The stack does the routing and serve the HTML and the assets for the applications. The assets of the applications are installed in the virtual file system. Install an application The manifest To install an application, cozy needs a manifest. It s a JSON document that describes the application (its name and icon for example), how to install it and what it needs for its usage (the permissions in particular). While we have considered to use the same manifest format as the W3C for PWAs , it didn t match our expectations. The manifest format for FirefoxOS is a better fit. We took a lot of inspirations from it, starting with the filename for this file: manifest.webapp . Field Description name the name to display on the home name_prefix the prefix to display with the name slug the default slug (it can be changed at install time) editor the editor s name to display on the cozy-bar of the app icon an icon for the home screenshots an array of path to the screenshots of the application category the category of the application short_description a short description of the application long_description a long description of the application source where the files of the app can be downloaded developer name and url for the developer locales translations of the name and description fields in other locales langs list of languages tags supported by the application version the current version number license the SPDX license identifier platforms a list of type , url values for derivate of the application for other devices intents a list of intents provided by this app (see here for more details) permissions a map of permissions needed by the app (see here for more details) notifications a map of notifications needed by the app (see here for more details) services a map of the services associated with the app (see below for more details) routes a map of routes for the app (see below for more details) Routes A route make the mapping between the requested paths and the files. It can have an index, which is an HTML file, with a token injected on it that identify both the application. This token must be used with the user cookies to use the services of the cozy-stack. By default, a route can be only visited by the authenticated owner of the instance where the app is installed. But a route can be marked as public. In that case, anybody can visit the route. For example, an application can offer an administration interface on /admin , a public page on /public , and shared assets in /assets : { /admin : { folder : / , index : admin.html , public : false }, /public : { folder : /public , index : index.html , public : true }, /assets : { folder : /assets , public : true } } If an application has no routes in its manifest, the stack will create one route, this default one: { / : { folder : / , index : index.html , public : false } } Note : if you have a public route, it s probably better to put the app icon in it. So, the cozy-bar can display it for the users that go on the public part of the app. Services Application may require background and offline process to analyse the user s data and emit some notification or warning even without the user being on the application. These part of the application are called services and can be declared as part of the application in its manifest. In contrast to konnectors , services have the same permissions as the web application and are not intended to collect outside informations but rather analyse the current set of collected information inside the cozy. However they share the same mechanisms as the konnectors to describe how and when they should be executed: via our trigger system. To define a service, first the code needs to be stored with the application content, as single (packaged) javascript files. In the manifest, declare the service and its parameters following this example: { services : { low-budget-notification : { type : node , file : /services/low-budget-notification.js , trigger : @cron 0 0 0 * * * } // ... } } The trigger field should follow the available triggers described in the jobs documentation . The file field should specify the service code run and the type field describe the code type (only \"node\" for now). Available fields to the service During the service execution, the stack will give some environment variables to the service if you need to use them. - COZY_URL # Cozy URL - COZY_CREDENTIALS # The cozy app related token - COZY_LANGUAGE # Lang used for the service (ex: node) - COZY_LOCALE # Locale of the Cozy - COZY_TIME_LIMIT # Maximum execution time. After this, the job will be killed - COZY_JOB_ID # Job ID - COZY_COUCH_DOC # The CouchDB document which triggers the service Notifications For more informations on how te declare notifications in the manifest, see the notifications documentation . Here is an example: { notifications : { account-balance : { description : Alert the user when its account balance is negative , collapsible : true , // only interested in the last value of the notification multiple : true , // require sub-categories for each account stateful : false , default_priority : high , // high priority for this notification templates : { mail : file:./notifications/account-balance-mail.tpl } } } } Resource caching To help caching of applications assets, we detect the presence of a unique identifier in the name of assets: a unique identifier is matched when the file base name contains a long hexadecimal subpart between . , of at least 10 characters. For instance app.badf00dbadf00d.js or icon.badbeefbadbeef.1.png . With such a unique identifier, the asset is considered immutable, and a long cache-control is added on corresponding HTTP responses. We recommend the use of bundling tools like webpack which offer the possibility to add such identifier on the building step of the application packages for all assets. Sources Here is the available sources, defined by the scheme of the source URL: registry:// : to install an application from the instance registries git:// or git+ssh:// : to install an application from a git repository http:// or https:// : to install an application from an http server (via a tarball) file:// : to install an application from a local directory (for instance: file:///home/user/code/cozy-app ) The registry scheme expect the following elements: scheme: registry host: the name of the application path: /:channel the channel of the application (see the registry doc) Examples: registry://drive/stable , registry://drive/beta , and registry://drive/dev . For the git scheme, the fragment in the URL can be used to specify which branch to install. For the http and https schemes, the fragment can be used to give the expected sha256sum. POST /apps/:slug Install an application, ie download the files and put them in /apps/:slug in the virtual file system of the user, create an io.cozy.apps document, register the permissions, etc. This endpoint is asynchronous and returns a successful return as soon as the application installation has started, meaning we have successfully reached the manifest and started to fetch application data. To make this endpoint synchronous, use the header Accept: text/event-stream . This will make a eventsource stream sending the manifest and returning when the application has been installed or failed. Status codes 202 Accepted, when the application installation has been accepted. 400 Bad-Request, when the manifest of the application could not be processed (for instance, it is not valid JSON). 404 Not Found, when the manifest or the source of the application is not reachable. 422 Unprocessable Entity, when the sent data is invalid (for example, the slug is invalid or the Source parameter is not a proper or supported url) Query-String Parameter Description Source URL from where the app can be downloaded (only for install) The Source parameter is optional: by default, the stable channel of the registry will be used.

It is useful if there are newer permissions or Terms Of Service and you want to be sure they were read or accepted. If set to false , the update will be blocked and the user will be told that a new app version is available.\\ Note: PermissionsAcked can be skipped. \\ If an instance is in a context configured with the parameter permissions_skip_verification sets to true , permissions verification will be ignored. Source (defaults to SourceURL installation parameter): Use a different source to update this app (e.g. to install a beta or dev app version) Examples: You have an email application on a stable channel, and you want to update it to a particular beta version: PUT /apps/emails?Source=https:// apps-repository /emails/1.0.0-beta HTTP / 1.1 Accept : application/vnd.api+json You want to attempt the email app update, but prevent it if new permissions were added PUT /apps/emails?PermissionsAcked=false HTTP / 1.1 Accept : application/vnd.api+json You can combine these parameters to use a precise app version and stay on another channel (when permissions are different): Install a version (e.g. 1.0.0 ) Ask an update to stable channel with PermissionsAcked to false Source will be stable , and your version remains 1.0.0 List installed applications GET /apps/ An application can be in one of these states: installed , the application is installed but still require some user interaction to accept its permissions ready , the user can use it installing , the installation is running and the app will soon be usable upgrading , a new version is being installed errored , the app is in an error state and can not be used.

On the main domain ( cozy.example.org ), there will be the registration process, the login form, and it will redirect to home.cozy.example.org for logged-in users. Rationale The applications have different roles and permissions. An application is identified when talking to the stack via a token. The token has to be injected in the application, one way or another, and it have to be unaccessible from other apps. If the applications run on the same domain (for example https://cozy.example.org/apps/calendar ), it s nearly impossible to protect an application to take the token of another application. The security model of the web is based too heavily on Same Origin Policy for that. If the token is put in the html of the index.html page of an app, another app can use the fetch API to get the html page, parse its content and extract the token. We can think of other ways to inject the token (indexeddb, URL, cookies) but none will provide a better isolation. Maybe in a couple years, when the origin spec will be more advanced. So, if having the apps on the same origin is not possible, we have to put them on several origins. One interesting way to do that is using sandboxed iframes. An iframe with the sandbox attribute , and not allow-same-origin in it, will be assigned to a unique origin. The W3C warns: Potentially hostile files should not be served from the same server as the file containing the iframe element. Sandboxing hostile content is of minimal help if an attacker can convince the user to just visit the hostile content directly, rather than in the iframe. To limit the damage that can be caused by hostile HTML content, it should be served from a separate dedicated domain. Using a different domain ensures that scripts in the files are unable to attack the site, even if the user is tricked into visiting those pages directly, without the protection of the sandbox attribute. It may be possible to disable all html pages to have an html content-type, except the home, and having the home loading the apps in a sandboxed iframe, via the srcdoc attribute. But, it will mean that we will have to reinvent nearly everything. Even showing an image can no longer be done via an img tag, it will need to use post-message with the home. Such a solution is difficult to implement, is a very fragile (both for the apps developer than for security) and is an hell to debug when it breaks. Clearly, it s not an acceptable solution. Thus, the only choice is to have several origins, and sub-domains is the best way for that. Of course, it has the downside to be more complicated to deploy (DNS and TLS certificates). But, in the tradeoff between security and ease of administration, we definetively take the security first. Routes Should we be concerned that all the routes are on the same sub-domain? No, it s not an issue. There are two types of routes: the ones that are publics and those reserved to the authenticated user. Public routes have no token Private routes are private, they can be accessed only with a valid session cookie, ie by the owner of the instance. Another application can t use the user cookies to read the token, because of the restrictions of the same origin policy (they are on different domains). And the application can t use an open proxy to read the private route, because it doesn t have the user cookies for that (the cookie is marked as httpOnly ).","title":"/apps - Applications Management"},{"location":"cozy-stack/apps/#applications","text":"It s possible to manage serverless applications from the cozy stack and serve them via cozy stack.

It s a JSON document that describes the application (its name and icon for example), how to install it and what it needs for its usage (the permissions in particular). While we have considered to use the same manifest format as the W3C for PWAs , it didn t match our expectations. The manifest format for FirefoxOS is a better fit. We took a lot of inspirations from it, starting with the filename for this file: manifest.webapp .

By default, a route can be only visited by the authenticated owner of the instance where the app is installed. But a route can be marked as public. In that case, anybody can visit the route. For example, an application can offer an administration interface on /admin , a public page on /public , and shared assets in /assets : { /admin : { folder : / , index : admin.html , public : false }, /public : { folder : /public , index : index.html , public : true }, /assets : { folder : /assets , public : true } } If an application has no routes in its manifest, the stack will create one route, this default one: { / : { folder : / , index : index.html , public : false } } Note : if you have a public route, it s probably better to put the app icon in it.

However they share the same mechanisms as the konnectors to describe how and when they should be executed: via our trigger system. To define a service, first the code needs to be stored with the application content, as single (packaged) javascript files.

An application is identified when talking to the stack via a token. The token has to be injected in the application, one way or another, and it have to be unaccessible from other apps. If the applications run on the same domain (for example https://cozy.example.org/apps/calendar ), it s nearly impossible to protect an application to take the token of another application. The security model of the web is based too heavily on Same Origin Policy for that. If the token is put in the html of the index.html page of an app, another app can use the fetch API to get the html page, parse its content and extract the token. We can think of other ways to inject the token (indexeddb, URL, cookies) but none will provide a better isolation. Maybe in a couple years, when the origin spec will be more advanced. So, if having the apps on the same origin is not possible, we have to put them on several origins. One interesting way to do that is using sandboxed iframes. An iframe with the sandbox attribute , and not allow-same-origin in it, will be assigned to a unique origin. The W3C warns: Potentially hostile files should not be served from the same server as the file containing the iframe element. Sandboxing hostile content is of minimal help if an attacker can convince the user to just visit the hostile content directly, rather than in the iframe. To limit the damage that can be caused by hostile HTML content, it should be served from a separate dedicated domain. Using a different domain ensures that scripts in the files are unable to attack the site, even if the user is tricked into visiting those pages directly, without the protection of the sandbox attribute. It may be possible to disable all html pages to have an html content-type, except the home, and having the home loading the apps in a sandboxed iframe, via the srcdoc attribute. But, it will mean that we will have to reinvent nearly everything. Even showing an image can no longer be done via an img tag, it will need to use post-message with the home. Such a solution is difficult to implement, is a very fragile (both for the apps developer than for security) and is an hell to debug when it breaks. Clearly, it s not an acceptable solution. Thus, the only choice is to have several origins, and sub-domains is the best way for that. Of course, it has the downside to be more complicated to deploy (DNS and TLS certificates). But, in the tradeoff between security and ease of administration, we definetively take the security first.","title":"Rationale"},{"location":"cozy-stack/apps/#routes_1","text":"Should we be concerned that all the routes are on the same sub-domain?

Another application can t use the user cookies to read the token, because of the restrictions of the same origin policy (they are on different domains).

When the cozy-stack receives a request, it checks that the request is authorized, and if yes, it processes it and answers it. What about OAuth2? OAuth2 is about delegating an access to resources on a server to another party. It is a framework, not a strictly defined protocol, for organizing the interactions between these 4 actors: the resource owner, the user that can click on buttons the client, the website or application that would like to access the resources the authorization server, whose role is limited to give tokens but is central in OAuth2 interactions the resources server, the server that controls the resources. For cozy, both the authorization server and the resources server roles are played by the cozy-stack. The resource owner is the owner of a cozy instance. The client can be the cozy-desktop app, cozy-mobile, or many other applications. OAuth2, and its extensions, is a large world. At its core, there is 2 things: letting the client get a token issued by the authorization server, and using this token to access to the resources. OAuth2 describe 4 flows, called grant types, for the first part: Authorization code Implicit grant type Client credentials grant type Resource owner credentials grant type. On cozy, only the most typical one is used: authorization code. To start this flow, the client must have a client_id and client_secret . The Cozy stack implements the OAuth2 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol (an extension to OAuth2) to allow the clients to obtain them. OAuth2 has also 3 ways to use a token: in the query-string (even if the spec does not recommended it) in the POST body in the HTTP Authorization header. On cozy, only the HTTP header is supported. OAuth2 has a lot of assumptions. Let s see some of them and their consequences on Cozy: TLS is very important to secure the communications. in OAuth 1, there was a mechanism to sign the requests. But it was very difficult to get it right for the developers and was abandonned in OAuth2, in favor of using TLS. The Cozy instance are already accessible only in HTTPS, so there is nothing particular to do for that. There is a principle called TOFU, Trust On First Use. It said that if the user will give his permission for delegating access to its resources when the client will try to access them for the first time. Later, the client will be able to keep accessing them even if the user is no longer here to give his permissions. The client can t make the assumptions about when its tokens will work. The tokens have no meaning for him (like cookies in a browser), they are just something it got from the authorization server and can send with its request. The access token can expire, the user can revoke them, etc. OAuth 2.0 defines no cryptographic methods. But a developer that want to use it will have to put her hands in that. If you want to learn OAuth 2 in details, I recommend the OAuth 2 in Action book . The cozy stack as an authorization server In general, the cozy stack manages the authentication itself. This is what is described below. In some special cases, an integration with other softwares can be mandatory: this is possible to configure via delegated authentication . GET /auth/login Display a form with a password field to let the user authenticates herself to the cozy stack. This endpoint accepts a redirect parameter. If the user is already logged in, she will be redirected immediately. Else, the parameter will be transfered in the POST. This parameter can only contain a link to an application installed on the cozy (thus to a subdomain of the cozy instance). To protect against stealing authorization code with redirection, the fragment is always overriden: GET /auth/login?redirect=https://contacts.cozy.example.org/foo?bar#baz HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Cookie : ... Note : the redirect parameter should be URL-encoded. We haven t done that to make it clear what the path ( foo ), the query-string ( bar ), and the fragment ( baz ) are. HTTP / 1.1 302 Moved Temporarily Location : https://contacts.cozy.example.org/foo?bar# If the redirect parameter is invalid, the response will be 400 Bad Request . Same for other parameters, the redirection will happen only on success (even if OAuth2 says the authorization server can redirect on errors, it s very complicated to do it safely, and it is better to avoid this trap). POST /auth/login After the user has typed her passphrase and clicked on Login , a request is made to this endpoint. The redirect parameter is passed inside the body. If it is missing, the redirection will be made against the default target: the home application of this cozy instance. POST /auth/login HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded passphrase=p4ssw0rd redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fcontacts.cozy.example.org HTTP / 1.1 302 Moved Temporarily Set-Cookie : ... Location : https://contacts.cozy.example.org/foo When two-factor authentication (2FA) authentication is activated, this endpoint will not directly sent a redirection after this first passphrase step. In such case, a 200 OK response is sent along with a token value in the response (either in JSON if requested or directly in a new HTML form). Along with this token, on 2FA passcode is sent to the user via another transport (email for instance, depending on the user s preferences). Another request should be sent to the same endpoint with a valid pair (token, passcode) , ensuring that the user correctly entered its passphrase and received a fresh passcode by another mean. POST /auth/login HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded two-factor-token=123123123123 passcode=678678 redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fcontacts.cozy.example.org HTTP / 1.1 302 Moved Temporarily Set-Cookie : ... Location : https://contacts.cozy.example.org/foo DELETE /auth/login This can be used to log-out the user. An app token must be passed in the Authorization header, to protect against CSRF attack on this (this can part of bigger attacks like session fixation). DELETE /auth/login HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Cookie : seesioncookie.... Authorization : Bearer app-token DELETE /auth/login/others This can be used to log-out all active sessions except the one used by the request. This allow to disconnect any other users currenctly authenticated on the system.

DELETE /auth/login/others HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Cookie : seesioncookie.... Authorization : Bearer app-token GET /auth/passphrase_reset Display a form for the user to reset its password, in case he has forgotten it for example.

GET /auth/passphrase_reset HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : text/html Cookie : ... POST /auth/passphrase_reset After the user has clicked on the reset button of the passphrase reset form, it will execute a request to this endpoint. This endpoint will create a token for the user to actually renew his passphrase. The token has a short-live duration of about 15 minutes. After the token is created, it is sent to the user on its mailbox. This endpoint will redirect the user on the login form page. POST /auth/passphrase_reset HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded csrf_token=123456890 GET /auth/passphrase_renew Display a form for the user to enter a new password. This endpoint should be used with a token query parameter. This token makes sure that the user has actually reset its passphrase and should have been sent via its mailbox. GET /auth/passphrase_renew?token=123456789 HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : text/html Cookie : ... POST /auth/passphrase_renew After the user has entered its new passphrase in the renew passphrase form, a request is made to this endpoint to renew the passphrase. This endpoint requires a valid token to actually work. In case of a success, the user is redirected to the login form. POST /auth/passphrase_reset HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded csrf_token=123456890 passphrase_reset_token=123456789 passphrase=mynewpassphrase GET /auth/passphrase This page renders a form to set the password for an onboarding instance. This endpoint expects a valid registerToken parameter. In case of success, the instance is marked as onboarded and the user is redirected to his home. If the instance is already onboarded, the user is redirected to his home. GET /auth/passphrase/?registerToken=e0fbe2c5b90cdcdd9b3487b48b480e0b HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : text/html POST /auth/register This route is used by OAuth2 clients to dynamically register them-selves. See OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol for the details. The client must send a JSON request, with at least: redirect_uris , an array of strings with the redirect URIs that the client will use in the authorization flow client_name , human-readable string name of the client to be presented to the end-user during authorization software_id , an identifier of the software used by the client (it should remain the same for all instances of the client software, whereas client_id varies between instances). It can also send the optional fields: client_kind (possible values: web, desktop, mobile, browser, etc.) client_uri , URL string of a web page providing information about the client logo_uri , to display an icon to the user in the authorization flow policy_uri , URL string that points to a human-readable privacy policy document that describes how the deployment organization collects, uses, retains, and discloses personal data software_version , a version identifier string for the client software. notification_platform , to activate notifications on the associated device, this field specify the platform used to send notifications: \"android\" : for Android devices with notifications via Firebase Cloud Messageing \"ios\" : for iOS devices with notifications via APNS/2. notification_device_token , the token used to identify the mobile device for notifications The server gives to the client the previous fields and these informations: client_id client_secret registration_access_token Example: POST /auth/register HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : application/json Accept : application/json { redirect_uris : [ https://client.example.org/oauth/callback ], client_name : Client , software_id : github.com/example/client , software_version : 2.0.1 , client_kind : web , client_uri : https://client.example.org/ , logo_uri : https://client.example.org/logo.svg , policy_uri : https://client/example.org/policy } HTTP / 1.1 201 Created Content-Type : application/json { client_id : 64ce5cb0-bd4c-11e6-880e-b3b7dfda89d3 , client_secret : eyJpc3Mi[...omitted for brevity...] , client_secret_expires_at : 0 , registration_access_token : J9l-ZhwP[...omitted for brevity...] , grant_types : [ authorization_code , refresh_token ], response_types : [ code ], redirect_uris : [ https://client.example.org/oauth/callback ], client_name : Client , software_id : github.com/example/client , software_version : 2.0.1 , client_kind : web , client_uri : https://client.example.org/ , logo_uri : https://client.example.org/logo.svg , policy_uri : https://client/example.org/policy } Linked applications Some OAuth applications are a mobile or desktop version of a Cozy webapp. For them, it s possible to use a special software_id to make a link between the mobile/desktop application and the webapp. The software_id must be in a registry://slug format, like registry://drive for Cozy-Drive for example. When it is the case, the mobile/desktop will share its permissions with the webapp. It means several things: The mobile/desktop app will have the same permissions that the linked webapp. When a sharing by link is done in the mobile/desktop application, the linked webapp will be able to revoke it later, and vice versa. When the user accepts to give access to its Cozy to the mobile/desktop app, the linked webapp will be installed on the Cozy if it was not already the case. When the linked webapp is uninstalled, the right to access the Cozy for the mobile/desktop app will be revoked.

The parameters are: client_id , that identify the client redirect_uri , it has to be exactly the same as the one used in registration state , it s a protection against CSRF on the client (a random string generated by the client, that it can check when the user will be redirected with the authorization code. It can be used as a key in local storage for storing a state in a SPA). response_type , only code is supported scope , a space separated list of the permissions asked (like io.cozy.files:GET for read-only access to files).

They are a few differences, like the scope format (sharing rules, not permissions) and the redirection after the POST. POST /auth/access_token Now, the client can check that the state is correct, and if it is the case, ask for an access_token . It can use this route with the code given above.

The access tokens are formatted as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) , like this: Claim Fullname What it identifies aud Audience Identify the recipient where the token can be used (like access ) iss Issuer Identify the Cozy instance (its domain in fact) iat Issued At Identify when the token was issued (Unix timestamp) sub Subject Identify the client that can use the token scope Scope Identify the scope of actions that the client can accomplish The scope is used for permissions . Other tokens can be JWT with a similar formalism, or be a simple random value (when we want to have a clear revocation process). What happens when the user has lost her passphrase? She can reset it from the command-line, like this: $ cozy-stack instances reset-passphrase cozy.example.org ek0Jah1R A new password is generated and print in the console. Is two-factor authentication (2FA) possible? Yes, it s possible. Via the cozy-settings application, the two-factor authentication can be activated. Here is how it works in more details: On each connection, when the 2FA is activated, the user is asked for its passphrase first. When entering correct passphrase, the user is then asked for: a TOTP (Timebased One-Time password, RFC 6238) derived from a secret associated with the instance. a short term timestamped MAC with the same validity time-range and also derived from the same secret. The TOTP is valid for a time range of about 5 minutes. When sending a correct and still-valid pair (passcode, token) , the user is granted with authentication cookie. The passcode can be sent to the instance s owner via email \u2014 more transport shall be added later. Client-side apps Important : OAuth2 is not used here! The steps looks similar (like obtaining a token), but when going in the details, it doesn t match. How to register the application? The application is registered at install. See app management for details. How to get a token? When a user access an application, she first loads the HTML page. Inside this page, a token specific to this app is injected (only for private routes), via a templating method. We have prefered our custom solution to the implicit grant type of OAuth2 for 2 reasons: It has a better User Experience. The implicit grant type works with 2 redirections (the application to the stack, and then the stack to the application), and the first one needs JS to detect if the token is present or not in the fragment hash. It has a strong impact on the time to load the application. The implicit grant type of OAuth2 has a severe drawback on security: the token appears in the URL and is shown by the browser. It can also be leaked with the HTTP Referer header. The token will be given only for the authenticated user. For nested subdomains (like calendar.joe.example.net ), the session cookie from the stack is enough (it is for .joe.example.net ). But for flat subdomains (like joe-calendar.example.net ), it s more complicated. On the first try of the user, she will be redirected to the stack. As she is already logged-in, she will be redirected to the app with a session code (else she can login). This session code can be exchanged to a session cookie. A redirection will still happen to remove the code from the URL (it helps to avoid the code being saved in the browser history). For security reasons, the session code have the following properties: It can only be used once. It is tied to an application ( calendar in our example). It has a very short time span of validity (1 minute). How to use a token? The token can be sent to the cozy-stack as a Bearer token in the Authorization header, like this: GET /data/io.cozy.events/6494e0ac-dfcb-11e5-88c1-472e84a9cbee HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Authorization : Bearer application-token If the user is authenticated, her cookies will be sent automatically. The cookies are needed for a token to be valid. How to refresh a token? The token is valid only for 24 hours. If the application is opened for more than that, it will need to get a new token. But most applications won t be kept open for so long and it s okay if they don t try to refresh tokens. At worst, the user just had to reload its page and it will work again. The app can know it s time to get a new token when the stack starts sending 401 Unauthorized responses. In that case, it can fetches the same html page that it was loaded initially, parses it and extracts the new token. Third-party websites How to register the application? If a third-party websites would like to access a cozy, it had to register first. For example, a big company can have data about a user and may want to offer her a way to get her data back in her cozy. When the user is connected on the website of this company, she can give her cozy address. The website will then register on this cozy, using the OAuth2 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol, as explained above . How to get a token? To get an access token, it s enough to follow the authorization code flow of OAuth2: sending the user to the cozy, on the authorize page if the user approves, she is then redirected back to the client the client gets the access code and can exchange it to an access token. How to use a token? The access token can be sent as a bearer token, in the Authorization header of HTTP: GET /data/io.cozy.contacts/6494e0ac-dfcb-11e5-88c1-472e84a9cbee HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Accept : application/json Authorization : Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWV9.TJVA95OrM7E2cBab30RMHrHDcEfxjoYZgeFONFh7HgQ How to refresh a token? The access token will be valid only for 24 hours. After that, a new access token must be asked. To do that, just follow the refresh token flow, as explained above . Devices and browser extensions For devices and browser extensions, it is nearly the same than for third-party websites. The main difficulty is the redirect_uri. In OAuth2, the access code is given to the client by redirecting the user to an URL controlled by the client. But devices and browser extensions don t have an obvious URL for that. The IETF has published an RFC called OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps . Native apps on desktop A desktop native application can start an embedded webserver on localhost. The redirect_uri will be something like http://127.0.0.1:19856/callback . Native apps on mobile On mobile, the native apps can often register a custom URI scheme, like com.example.oauthclient:/ . Just be sure that no other app has registered itself with the same URI. Chrome extensions Chrome extensions can use URL like https:// extension-id .chromiumapp.org/ anything-here for their usage. See https://developer.chrome.com/apps/app_identity#non for more details. It has also a method to simplify the creation of such an URL: chrome.identity.getRedirectURL . Firefox extensions It is possible to use an out of band URN: urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob:auto . The token is then extracted from the title of the page. See this addon for google oauth2 as an example. Security considerations The password will be stored in a secure fashion, with a password hashing function. The hashing function and its parameter will be stored with the hash, in order to make it possible to change the algorithm and/or the parameters later if we had any suspicion that it became too weak. The initial algorithm is scrypt . The access code is valid only once, and will expire after 5 minutes Dynamically registered applications won t have access to all possible scopes. For example, an application that has been dynamically registered can t ask the cozy owner to give it the right to install other applications. This limitation should improve security, as avoiding too powerful scopes to be used with unknown applications. The cozy stack will apply rate limiting to avoid brute-force attacks. The cozy stack offers CORS for most of its services. But it s disabled for /auth (it doesn t make sense here) and for the client-side applications (to avoid leaking their tokens). The client should really use HTTPS for its redirect_uri parameter, but it s allowed to use HTTP for localhost, as in the native desktop app example. OAuth2 says that the state parameter is optional in the authorization code flow. But it is mandatory to use it with Cozy.

It is a framework, not a strictly defined protocol, for organizing the interactions between these 4 actors: the resource owner, the user that can click on buttons the client, the website or application that would like to access the resources the authorization server, whose role is limited to give tokens but is central in OAuth2 interactions the resources server, the server that controls the resources. For cozy, both the authorization server and the resources server roles are played by the cozy-stack. The resource owner is the owner of a cozy instance. The client can be the cozy-desktop app, cozy-mobile, or many other applications. OAuth2, and its extensions, is a large world. At its core, there is 2 things: letting the client get a token issued by the authorization server, and using this token to access to the resources. OAuth2 describe 4 flows, called grant types, for the first part: Authorization code Implicit grant type Client credentials grant type Resource owner credentials grant type. On cozy, only the most typical one is used: authorization code. To start this flow, the client must have a client_id and client_secret . The Cozy stack implements the OAuth2 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol (an extension to OAuth2) to allow the clients to obtain them. OAuth2 has also 3 ways to use a token: in the query-string (even if the spec does not recommended it) in the POST body in the HTTP Authorization header. On cozy, only the HTTP header is supported. OAuth2 has a lot of assumptions. Let s see some of them and their consequences on Cozy: TLS is very important to secure the communications. in OAuth 1, there was a mechanism to sign the requests. But it was very difficult to get it right for the developers and was abandonned in OAuth2, in favor of using TLS. The Cozy instance are already accessible only in HTTPS, so there is nothing particular to do for that. There is a principle called TOFU, Trust On First Use. It said that if the user will give his permission for delegating access to its resources when the client will try to access them for the first time. Later, the client will be able to keep accessing them even if the user is no longer here to give his permissions. The client can t make the assumptions about when its tokens will work. The tokens have no meaning for him (like cookies in a browser), they are just something it got from the authorization server and can send with its request. The access token can expire, the user can revoke them, etc. OAuth 2.0 defines no cryptographic methods. But a developer that want to use it will have to put her hands in that.

Here is how it works in more details: On each connection, when the 2FA is activated, the user is asked for its passphrase first. When entering correct passphrase, the user is then asked for: a TOTP (Timebased One-Time password, RFC 6238) derived from a secret associated with the instance. a short term timestamped MAC with the same validity time-range and also derived from the same secret.

We have prefered our custom solution to the implicit grant type of OAuth2 for 2 reasons: It has a better User Experience. The implicit grant type works with 2 redirections (the application to the stack, and then the stack to the application), and the first one needs JS to detect if the token is present or not in the fragment hash. It has a strong impact on the time to load the application. The implicit grant type of OAuth2 has a severe drawback on security: the token appears in the URL and is shown by the browser. It can also be leaked with the HTTP Referer header. The token will be given only for the authenticated user. For nested subdomains (like calendar.joe.example.net ), the session cookie from the stack is enough (it is for .joe.example.net ). But for flat subdomains (like joe-calendar.example.net ), it s more complicated. On the first try of the user, she will be redirected to the stack. As she is already logged-in, she will be redirected to the app with a session code (else she can login). This session code can be exchanged to a session cookie. A redirection will still happen to remove the code from the URL (it helps to avoid the code being saved in the browser history).

Stack endpoints By default, cozy-stack use plain-text local socket for client ( localhost:8080 ) and admin ( localhost:6060 ) communications. If you want to control a remote stack or using TLS to secure communications, you can configure your cozy-stack client with the following CLI arguments or environment variables. Argument Env variable Default value Usage --host / --admin-host COZY_HOST / COZY_ADMIN_HOST localhost `[http[s]://] [: ]` --port / --admin-port COZY_PORT / COZY_ADMIN_PORT 8080 / 6060 COZY_HOST_TIMEOUT / COZY_ADMIN_TIMOUT 15s HTTP timeout to use Must be [a valid golang duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) like `10s` or `1m` COZY_HOST_VALIDATE / COZY_ADMIN_VALIDATE true Enable HTTPS certificate validation Can also be set via host URL query part, like `https://localhost:6060?validate=false` COZY_HOST_CA / COZY_ADMIN_CA none CA file to use for HTTPS certificate validation Can also be set via host URL query part, like `https://localhost:6060?ca= ` COZY_HOST_CERT / COZY_ADMIN_CERT none Client certificate to use Can also be set via host URL query part, like `https://localhost:6060?cert= ` COZY_HOST_KEY / COZY_ADMIN_KEY none Client certificate to use Can also be set via host URL query part, like `https://localhost:6060?key= ` COZY_HOST_FINGERPRINT / COZY_ADMIN_FINGERPRINT none Hex-encoded SHA-256 key pinning to use Can also be set via host URL query part, like `https://localhost:6060?fp= ` You can get the fingerprint of a given certificate with `openssl x509 -in -pubkey | openssl pkey -pubin -outform der | openssl dgst -sha256 -hex` Or directly from a private key with `openssl pkey -in -pubout -outform der | openssl dgst -sha256 -hex` Administration secret To access to the administration API (the /admin/* routes), a secret passphrase should be stored in a cozy-admin-passphrase . This file should be in one of the configuration directories, along with the main config file. The passphrase is stored in a salted-hashed representation using scrypt. To generate this file, you can use the cozy-stack config passwd [filepath] command. This command will ask you for a passphrase and will create the cozy-admin-passphrase at the specified path. You can use the COZY_ADMIN_PASSWORD env variable if you do not want to type the passphrase each time you call cozy-stack . Example $ mkdir ~/.cozy cozy-stack config passwd ~/.cozy/cozy-admin-passphrase Hashed passphrase will be writtent in ~/.cozy/cozy-admin-passphrase Passphrase: Confirmation: $ cat ~/.cozy/cozy-admin-passphrase scrypt $16384$8$1$936 bd62faf633b5f946f653c21161a9b $4 e0d11dfa5fc1676ed329938b11a6584d30e603e0d06b8a63a99e8cec392d682 Hooks Cozy-stack can run scripts on some events to customize it. The scripts must be in the hooks directory defined in the config, have a predefined name, and be executable. Then, they should be fired automatically. Let s the available hooks. The pre-add-instance hook is run just before creating an instance. It can prevent the command from running by exiting with non-zero status. It can be used to check the domain for example. It is called with the following parameter: the domain of the instance that will be created. The post-add-instance hook is run just after an instance has been created. installed. It can be used to setup DNS for this instance for example. It is called with the following parameter: the domain of the instance that has been created. The pre-remove-instance hook is run just before destroying an instance. It can prevent the command from running by exiting with non-zero status. It can be used to make a backup of the instance before destroying it. It is called with the following parameter: the domain of the instance that will be destroyed. The post-remove-instance hook is run just after an instance has been destroyed. It can be used to do some cleanup. It is called with the following parameter: the domain of the instance that has been destroyed. The pre-install-app hook is run just before installing an application, and can prevent the command from running by exiting with non-zero status. It is called with the following parameters: the instance on which the application will be installed the application name that will be installed. The post-install-app hook is run just after an application has been installed. It can be used for logging, notification, statistics, etc. It s also a good place to add a vhost for an application in the reverse-proxy configuration, with a TLS certificate. It is called with the following parameters: the instance on which the application has been installed the application name that has been installed. The pre-uninstall-app hook is run just before uninstalling an application, and can prevent the command from running by exiting with non-zero status. It is called with the following parameters: the instance on which the application will be uninstalled the application name that will be uninstalled. The post-uninstall-app hook is run just after an application has been uninstalled. It can be used for cleaning the configuration of the reverse- proxy for example. It is called with the following parameters: the instance on which the application has been uninstalled the application name that has been uninstalled. Customizing a context Intro In the config file of cozy-stack, it s possible to declare some contexts, that are a way to regroup some cozy instances to give similar configuration. For example, it is possible to give a default_redirection that will be used when the user logs into their cozy. You can find more example in the example config file. Assets The visual appearance of a cozy instance can be customized via some assets (CSS, JS, images). These assets can be inserted from the command-line with the cozy-stack config insert-asset command. Here are a small list of assets that you may want to customize: /styles/theme.css : a CSS file where you can override the colors and put other CSS rules /favicon-16x16.png and /favicon-32x32.png : the two variants of the favicon /apple-touch-icon.png : the same but for Apple /images/default-avatar.png : the image to use as the default avatar. /images/icon-cozy-home.svg : the home icon used and displayed by the cozy-bar.","title":"Configuration file"},{"location":"cozy-stack/config/#configuration","text":"","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"cozy-stack/config/#main-configuration-file","text":"You can configure your cozy-stack using a configuration file.

For false , a more heavy solution is required: a partial index . Index selection CouchDB may accept or refuse to use a mango index for a query, with obsure reasons. In general, you can follow these two rules of thumb: An index on the fields foo, bar, baz can be used only to fetch documents where foo , bar , and baz exist. It means that a query that filters only on the value on foo won t use the mango index, because it can miss a document where foo has the expected value but without bar or baz . If you know that all the documents that you want have the bar and baz fields, you can just add two filters $exists: true (one for bar , the other for baz ). You should use exactly the same sequence of fields for creating the index and the sort operator of the query. If you have an index on os, browser, ip for the io.cozy.sessions.logins , and you want to have all the documents for a login from windows , sorted by browser , you can use the index, but you should use os, browser, ip for the sort (or at least os, browser , even if it is seems to weird to sort on os when all the sorted documents will have the same value, windows ). Please note that using use_index on a request, the results will be sorted by default according to this rule. So, you can omit the sort operator on the query (except if you want the descending order). Old revisions CouchDB keeps for each document a list of its revision (or more exactly a tree with replication and conflicts). It s possible to ask the list of the old revisions of a document with GET /db/{docid}?revs_info=true . It works only if the document has not been deleted. For a deleted document, a trick is to query the changes feed to know the last revision of the document, and to recreate the document from this revision. With an old revision, it s possible to get the content of the document at this revision with GET /db/{docid}?rev={rev} if the database was not compacted. On CouchDB 2.x, compacts happen automatically on all databases from times to times. A purge operation consists to remove the tombstone for the deleted documents. It is a manual operation, triggered by a POST /db/_purge . Conflicts It is possible to create a conflict on CouchDB like it does for the replication by using new_edits , but it is not well documented to say the least. The more accurate description is on the old wiki: https://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/HTTP_Bulk_Document_API#Posting_Existing_Revisions.

It registers the instance in a global couchdb database global/instances and creates the proper databases ($PREFIX/$DOCTYPE) for these doctypes: io.cozy.apps io.cozy.contacts io.cozy.files io.cozy.jobs io.cozy.konnectors io.cozy.notifications io.cozy.oauth.clients io.cozy.permissions io.cozy.sessions.logins io.cozy.settings io.cozy.shared io.cozy.sharings io.cozy.triggers Then, it creates some indexes for these doctypes, and some directories: / , with the id io.cozy.files.root-dir the trash, with the id io.cozy.files.trash-dir /Administrative /Photos /Photos/Uploaded from Cozy Photos /Photos/Backed up from my mobile The names are localized: If a locale is provided through the CLI, the directories will be created with names in this locale. Then it creates the basic settings with the options from the CLI. Finally, applications from the --apps CLI option are installed. Onboarding At the end of the instance creation, the CLI returns a token, called registerToken . The registerToken can be used to send a link to the user, where they will be able to choose their password. After that, the instance is said to be onboarded, and the user can use it normally. Destroying An instance is destroyed through the command line. A confirmation is asked from the CLI user unless the force flag is passed: $ cozy-stack instances destroy domain Blocking If you manage several instances on your stack, you can block some instances. When an instance is blocked (for whatever reason), the user cannot use his Cozy anymore and has to wait to be unblocked. $ cozy-stack instances modify domain --blocked A blocking_reason can be added for specific cases and to inform a user the reason of the blocking. Several pre-included reasons are included, but you can define your owns if needed.

Manifest 2. Intent Start 3. Service Resolution 4. Handshake 5. Processing Terminating Routes Annexes Use cases Bibliography Prior Art Discarded Ideas Overview A typical Cozy Cloud runs multiple applications, but most of these applications are focused on one task and interact with one particular type of data. However, Cozy Cloud especially shines when data is combined across apps to provide an integrated experience. This is made difficult by the fact that apps have no dedicated back-end and that they have restricted access to documents. This document outlines a proposal for apps to rely on each other to accomplish certain tasks and gain access to new documents, in a way that hopefully is neither painful for the users nor the developers. Glossary Intent : Intents, sometimes also called Activities, is a pattern used in environments where multiple apps with different purposes coexist. The idea is that any app can express the need to do something that it can t do itself, and an app that can do it will take over from there. Stack : refers to cozy-stack , the server-side part of the Cozy infrastructure. Client : the client is the application that starts an intent. Service : the service is the application that handles an intent started by a client. Available apps : Uninstalled applications that handles the intent. Proposal In this proposal, services declare themselves through their manifest. When a clients starts an intent, the stack finds the appropriate service and help the two apps to create a communication channel between them. After the channel is ready, the intent is processed. These steps are detailed below. 1. Manifest Every app can register itself as a potential handler for one or more intents. To do so, it must provide the following information for each intent it wishes to handle: action : A verb that describes what the service should do. The most common actions are CREATE , EDIT , OPEN , PICK , and SHARE . While we recommend using one of these verbs, the list is not exhaustive and may be extended by any app. type : One or more types of data on which the service knows how to operate the action . A type can be expressed as a MIME type or a Cozy Document Type . The application must have permissions for any Cozy Document Type listed here. You can also think of the type as the intent s subject. href : the relative URL of the route designed to handle this intent. A query-string with the intent id will be added to this URL. These informations must be provided in the manifest of the application, inside the intents key. Here is a very simple example: intents : [ { action : PICK , type : [ io.cozy.files ], href : /pick } ] When this service is called, it will load the page https://service.domain.example.com/pick?intent=123abc . Here is an example of an app that supports multiple data types: intents : [ { action : PICK , type : [ io.cozy.files , image/* ], href : /pick } ] Finally, here is an example of an app that supports several intent types: intents : [ { action : PICK , type : [ io.cozy.files , image/* ], href : /pick }, { action : VIEW , type : [ image/gif ], href : /viewer } ] This information is stored by the stack when the application is installed. 2. Intent Start Any app can start a new intent whenever it wants. When it does, the app becomes the client . To start an intent, it must specify the following information: action : an action verb, which will be matched against the actions declared in services manifest files. type : a single data type, which will be matched against the types declared in services manifest files. There are also two optional fields that can be defined at the start of the intent: data : Any data that the client wants to make available to the service. data must be a JSON object but its structure is left to the discretion of the client. The only exception is when type is a MIME type and the client wishes to send a file to the service. In that case, the file should be represented as a base-64 encoded Data URL and must be named content . This convention is also recomended when dealing with other intent type s. See the examples below for an example of this. permissions : When type is a Cozy Document Type and the client expects to receive one or more documents as part of the reply from the service, the permissions field allows the client to request permissions for these documents. permissions is a list of HTTP Verbs. Refer to this section of the permission documentation for more information. Note : if the intent s subject is a Cozy Doctype that holds references to other Cozy Documents (such as an album referencing photos or a playlist referencing music files), the permissions should be granted for the referenced documents too, whenever possible. Here is an example of what the API could look like: // Let the user pick a file cozy . intents . start ( PICK , io.cozy.files ) . then ( document = { // document is a JSON representation of the picked file }); // Create a contact, with some information already filled out cozy . intents . start ( CREATE , io.cozy.contacts , { name : John Johnsons , tel : +12345678 email : john@johnsons.com }) . then ( document = { // document is a JSON representation of the contact that was created }); // Save this file somewhere cozy . intents . start ( CREATE , io.cozy.files , { content : data:application/zip;base64,UEsDB... , name : photos.zip }); // Create a new note, and give me read-only access to it cozy . intents . start ( CREATE , io.cozy.notes , {}, [ GET ]) . then ( document = { // document is a JSON representation of the note that was created. // Additionally, this note can now be retrieved through the API since we have read access on it. }); // Create an event based on the provided data, and give me full access to it cozy . intents . start ( CREATE , io.cozy.events , { date : 2017/06/24 , title : Beach day }, [ ALL ]) . then ( document = { // document is a JSON representation of the note that was created. // Additionally, this note can now be retrieved through the API since we have read access on it. }); // Crop this picture cozy . intents . start ( EDIT , image/png , { content : data:image/png;base64,iVBORw... , width : 50 , height : 50 }) . then ( image = { //image is the edited version of the image provided above. }) 3. Service Resolution The service resolution is the phase where a service is chosen to handle an intent. This phase is handled by the stack. After the client has started it s intent, it sends the action , the type and the permissions to the stack. The stack will then traverse the list of installed apps and find all the apps that can handle that specific combination. Note that if the intent request GET permissions on a certain Cozy Document Type, but the service does not have this permission itself, it can not handle the intent. The stack then stores the information for that intent: A unique id for that intent Client URL Service URL action type permissions Finally, the service URL is suffixed with ?intent= followed by the intent s id, and then sent to the client. 4. Available apps In addition to the services that manage intents, a list of available (but not installed) applications of the instance that handles the intent is returned. This object list is called availableApps and contains: - The application slug - The application name Service choice If more than one service match the intent s criteria, the stack returns the list of all matching service URLs to the client (and stores it in the service URL version of the intent it keeps in memory). The client is then free to pick one arbitrarily. The client may also decide to let the user choose one of the services. To do this, it should start another intent with a PICK action and a io.cozy.apps type . This intent should be resolved by the stack to a special page, in order to avoid having multiple services trying to handle it and ending up in a loop. This special page is a service like any other; it expects the list of services to pick from as input data, and will return the one that has been picked to the client. The client can then proceed with the first intent. The user may decide to abort the intent before picking a service. If that is the case, the choice page will need to inform the client that the intent was aborted. No available service If no service is available to handle an intent, the stack returns an error to the client. However, some non-installed applications may handle the intent, and are listed in the availableApps field. 4. Handshake The next phase consist of the client and the service establishing a communication channel between them. The communication will be done using the window.postMessage API. Service Initialization When the client receives the service URL from the stack, it starts to listen for messages coming from that URL. Once the listener is started, it opens an iframe that points to the service s URL. Service to Client At this point, the service app is opened on the route that it provided in the href part of it s manifest. This route now also contains the intent s id. The service queries the stack to find out information about the intent, passing along the intent id. In response, the stack sends the client s URL, the action , and the type . If the intent includes permissions , the stack sends them too, as well as the client s permission id. It then starts to listen for messages coming from the client s URL. Eventually, it sends a message to the client, as a mean to inform it that the service is now ready. Client to Service After the client receives the ready message from the service, it sends a message to the service acknowledging the ready state. Along with this message, it should send the data that was provided at the start of the intent, if any. 5. Processing Terminating After this handshake, there is a confirmed communication channel between the client and the service, and the service knows what it has to do. This is the phase where the user interacts with the service. If the service is going to grant extra permissions to the client app, it is strongly recommended to make this clear to the user. When the service has finished his task, it sends a completed message to the client. Permissions extensions should have been done before that. Along with the completed message, the service should send any data it deems relevant. This data should be a JSON object. Again, the structure of that object is left to the discretion of the service, except when type is a MIME type. In that case, the file should be represented as a base-64 encoded Data URL and must be named content . This convention is also recomended when dealing with other intent type s. After the client receives a completed message, it can close the service s iframe and resume operations as usual. If, for whatever reason, the service can not fulfill the intent, it can send an error message to the client. When the client receives an error message, the intent is aborted and the iframe can be closed. Routes POST /intents The client app can ask to start an intent via this route. Any client-side app can call this route, no permission is needed. Request POST /intents HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.net Authorization : Bearer eyJhbG...

Since we were unable to find a use case where a new window is required, we decided not to include the disposition in this specification. It might be added later if the need arises. Client / Server architecture Instead of letting the two applications communicate with each other, they could be made to talk through the stack. This would be useful as the stack could act as a middleware, transforming data on the fly or granting permissions where appropriate. However, this approach has also severe drawbacks, notably the fact that the stack must hold a copy of all the data that the apps want to transfer (which can include large files). It also makes it significantly harder for the client to know when the intent has been processed. Data representation The client could explicitly request a data format to be used in the communication. However, this idea was abandoned because the format is always json, except when then intent s type is a MIME type, in which case the data format also uses this type.","title":"/intents - Intents"},{"location":"cozy-stack/intents/#intents","text":"Overview Glossary Proposal 1.

These tasks can be scheduled in advance, recurring or sudden and provide various services. At the time, we do not provide generic and programmable tasks. This list of available workers is part of the defined API. The job queue can be either local to the cozy-stack when used as a monolithic instance (self-hosted for instance) or distributed via a redis server for distributed infrastructures. This doc introduces two cozy types: io.cozy.jobs for jobs io.cozy.triggers for triggers Triggers Jobs can be queued up via the /jobs/queue/:worker-type API, for a direct execution. But it can also be convenient to schedule jobs on some conditions, and the triggers are the way to do that. Jobs can be launched by five different types of triggers: @at to schedule a one-time job executed after at a specific time in the future @in to schedule a one-time job executed after a specific amount of time @every to schedule periodic jobs executed at a given fix interval @cron to schedule recurring jobs scheduled at specific times @event to launch a job after a change on documents in the cozy. These five triggers have specific syntaxes to describe when jobs should be scheduled. See below for more informations. @at syntax The @at trigger takes a ISO-8601 formatted string indicating a UTC time in the future. The date is of this form: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ Examples @at 2018-12-12T15:36:25.507Z @in syntax The @in trigger takes the same duration syntax as @every Examples @in 10m @in 1h30m @every syntax The @every trigger uses the same syntax as golang s time.ParseDuration (but only support time units above seconds): A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as 300ms , 1.5h or 2h45m . Valid time units are s , m , h . Examples @every 1.5h # schedules every 1 and a half hours @every 30m10s # schedules every 30 minutes and 10 seconds @cron syntax In order to schedule recurring jobs, the @cron trigger has the syntax using six fields: Field name Mandatory? Allowed values Allowed special characters Seconds Yes 0-59 * / , - Minutes Yes 0-59 * / , - Hours Yes 0-23 * / , - Day of month Yes 1-31 * / , - ? Month Yes 1-12 or JAN-DEC * / , - Day of week Yes 0-6 or SUN-SAT * / , - ? Asterisk ( * ) The asterisk indicates that the cron expression will match for all values of the field; e.g., using an asterisk in the 5th field (month) would indicate every month. Slash ( / ) Slashes are used to describe increments of ranges. For example 3-59/15 in the 1st field (minutes) would indicate the 3rd minute of the hour and every 15 minutes thereafter. The form \"*\\/...\" is equivalent to the form \"first-last/...\" , that is, an increment over the largest possible range of the field. The form \"N-/...\" is accepted as meaning \"N-MAX/...\" , that is, starting at N, use the increment until the end of that specific range. It does not wrap around. Comma ( , ) Commas are used to separate items of a list. For example, using \"MON,WED,FRI\" in the 5th field (day of week) would mean Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Hyphen ( - ) Hyphens are used to define ranges. For example, 9-17 would indicate every hour between 9am and 5pm inclusive. Question mark ( ? ) Question mark may be used instead of * for leaving either day-of-month or day-of-week blank. To schedule jobs given an interval: Examples: @cron 0 0 0 1 1 * # Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st @cron 0 0 0 1 1 * # Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st @cron 0 0 0 1 * * # Run once a month, midnight, first of month @cron 0 0 0 * * 0 # Run once a week, midnight on Sunday @cron 0 0 0 * * * # Run once a day, midnight @cron 0 0 * * * * # Run once an hour, beginning of hour @event syntax The @event syntax allows to trigger a job when something occurs in the stack. It follows the same syntax than permissions scope string: type[:verb][:values][:selector] Unlike for permissions string, the verb should be one of CREATED , DELETED , UPDATED . The job worker will receive a compound message including original trigger_infos messages and the event which has triggered it. Examples @event io.cozy.files // anything happens on files @event io.cozy.files:CREATED // a file was created @event io.cozy.files:DELETED:image/jpg:mime // an image was deleted @event io.cozy.bank.operations:CREATED io.cozy.bank.bills:CREATED // a bank operation or a bill @event io.cozy.bank.operations:CREATED,UPDATED // a bank operation created or updated Error Handling Jobs can fail to execute their task. We have two ways to parameterize such cases. Retry A retry count can be optionally specified to ask the worker to re-execute the task if it has failed. Each retry is executed after a configurable delay. The try count is part of the attributes of the job. Also, each occurring error is kept in the errors field containing all the errors that may have happened. Timeout A worker may never end. To prevent this, a configurable timeout value is specified with the job. If a job does not end after the specified amount of time, it will be aborted. A timeout is just like another error from the worker and can provoke a retry if specified. Defaults By default, jobs are parameterized with a maximum of 3 tries with 1 minute timeout. These defaults may vary given the workload of the workers. Jobs API Example and description of the attributes of a io.cozy.jobs : { domain : me.cozy.tools , worker : sendmail , // worker type name options : { priority : 3 , // priority from 1 to 100, higher number is higher priority timeout : 60 , // timeout value in seconds max_exec_count : 3 , // maximum number of time the job should be executed (including retries) }, arguments : { // the arguments will be given to the worker (if you look in CouchDB, it is called message there) mode : noreply , template_name : new_registration , template_values : { DevicesLink : http://me.cozy.tools/#/connectedDevices , } }, state : running , // queued, running, errored queued_at : 2016-09-19T12:35:08Z , // time of the queuing started_at : 2016-09-19T12:35:08Z , // time of first execution error : // error message if any } Example and description of a job creation options \u2014 as you can see, the options are replicated in the io.cozy.jobs attributes: { priority : 3 , // priority from 1 to 100 timeout : 60 , // timeout value in seconds max_exec_count : 3 , // maximum number of retry } GET /jobs/:job-id Get a job informations given its ID.

See triggers descriptions to see the types of trigger and their arguments syntax. This route requires a specific permission on the worker type. A global permission on the global io.cozy.triggers doctype is not allowed. The debounce parameter can be used to limit the number of jobs created in a burst. It delays the creation of the job on the first input by the given time argument, and if the trigger has its condition matched again during this period, it won t create another job. It can be useful to combine it with the changes feed of couchdb with a last sequence number persisted by the worker, as it allows to have a nice diff between two executions of the worker.

When used on a specific worker, the permission can be specified on the worker field. Worker pool The consuming side of the job queue is handled by a worker pool. On a monolithic cozy-stack, the worker pool has a configurable fixed size of workers. The default value is not yet determined. Each time a worker has finished a job, it check the queue and based on the priority and the queued date of the job, picks a new job to execute. Permissions In order to prevent jobs from leaking informations between applications, we may need to add filtering per applications: for instance one queue per applications. We should also have an explicit check on the permissions of the applications before launching a job scheduled by an application. For more information, refer to our permission document . Multi-stack When some instances are served by several stacks, the scheduling and running of jobs can be distributed on the stacks. The synchronization is done via redis. For scheduling, there is one important key in redis: triggers . It s a sorted set. The members are the identifiants of the triggers (with the domain name), and the score are the timestamp of the next time the trigger should occur. During the short period of time where a trigger is processed, its key is moved to scheduling (another sorted set). So, even if a stack crash during processing a trigger, this trigger won t be lost. For @event triggers, we don t use the same mechanism. Each stack has all the triggers in memory and is responsible to trigger them for the events generated by the HTTP requests of their API. They also publish them on redis: this pub/sub is used for the realtime API.","title":"/jobs - Jobs"},{"location":"cozy-stack/jobs/#jobs","text":"Jobs are designed to represent asynchronous tasks that your cozy can execute.

Aggregator accounts Some konnectors are based on an aggregator service. An aggregator is declared in the konnector manifest and specify an accountId property. When Cozy-Home detects this property, it checks if an account with this given id exists. If not, it creates it. Every account created for a konnector based on an aggregator is then related to this aggregator account. This relationship is called parent account. { auth : { login : 000000000 , password : ********** }, folderPath : /Administratif/Bankbank , label : Bankbank , namePath : Bankbank , relationships : { parent : { _id : service-aggregator-account , _type : io.cozy.accounts } } } Note: you can read more about the accounts doctype here . Konnectors io.cozy.konnectors are installed similarly to io.cozy.apps (see doc ) Permissions Like client-side applications, each konnector has an associated io.cozy.permissions . These permissions are those listed on the manifest of the konnectors, and the stack will add a permission for the files on the folder choosen by the user. Triggers io.cozy.triggers are used to define when konnectors are launched. See https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-stack/jobs/#post-jobstriggers Complete flow example As a user, from the expenses management app, I have a clean flow to configure a connector to retrieve my travel expenses 1 - User is in my-expenses and clicks on [configure travels] 2 - my-expenses triggers an intent cozy . intents . start ( CREATE , io.cozy.konnectors , { category : transport }); 3 - the Store app catch the intent, fetch all available konnectors and let the user choose GET /registry?... HTTP / 1.1 4 - the user chooses the trainline konnector. Its manifest looks like this: { name : Trainline , type : konnector , slug : konnector-trainline , description : Konnector for trainline . com , source : https://github.com/konnectors/trainlines.git@build , developer : { name : XXX , url : https://www.xxx.fr }, version : 3.0.0 , licence : AGPL-3.0 , fields : { login : { type : text }, password : { type : password }, advancedFields : { folderPath : { advanced : true , isRequired : false } } }, category : transport , frequency : weekly , permissions : { events : { description : Connect train bill with event in your calendar , type : io.cozy.events , verbs : [ PATCH ] } } } 5 - the user clicks on install, and the install starts: POST /konnectors/trainline HTTP / 1.1 6 - the Store then uses an intent to know which app can configure this konnector: cozy . intents . start ( REDIRECT , io.cozy.accounts , { slug : trainline }); 7 - the Store redirects to the Home. The Home asks the user for account config and create a folder to save the PDFs. 8 - the Home also add a Reference from the konnector to the folder to prevent any accidental folder deletion: POST /files/123-selected-folder-id-123/relationships/referenced_by { data : [ { type : io.cozy.konnectors , id : io.cozy.konnectors/trainlines } ] } 9 - then the Home can create the account: POST /data/io.cozy.accounts HTTP / 1.1 { account_type : trainline , auth : { login : xxxx , password : yyyyy }, folderPath : /Administrative/Trainline } HTTP / 1.1 200 OK { _id : 123-account-id-123 , _rev : 1-asasasasa , account_type : trainline , auth : { login : xxxx , }, folderPath : /Administrative/Trainline } 10 - the Home create the trigger: POST /jobs/io.cozy.triggers { data : { attributes : { type : @cron , arguments : 0 0 0 0 1 1 , worker : konnector , message : { konnector : trainline , account : 5165621628784562148955 , folder_to_save : 877854878455 } } } } 11 - and, finally, the Home runs the konnector for the first time: POST /jobs/triggers/abc159753/launch HTTP / 1.1 12 - the Home uses the realtime to be informed if the konnector fails to login or succeeds to import the PDFs. If the user wants to use several account, the Home can setup several triggers for the same konnector various accounts. Konnector Worker specs Prepare the execution The cozy-stack prepares the execution of the konnector by doing these steps: it checks that the konnector is not in maintenance in the registry (execpt for manual execution) it ensures that the konnector has a folder where it can write its files, and has the permission to write in this folder. Execute the konnector Start the konnector through nsjail, passing as ENV variables : - `COZY_URL`: the starting instance URL - `COZY_CREDENTIALS`: security token to communicate with Cozy - `COZY_FIELDS`: JSON-encoded message with the arguments from the trigger - `COZY_PARAMETERS`: JSON-encoded parameters from the konnector manifest - `COZY_LANGUAGE`: the language field of the konnector (eg. node etc.) - `COZY_LOCALE`: the locale of the user (eg. en etc.) - `COZY_TIME_LIMIT`: how much time the konnector can run before being killed - `COZY_JOB_ID`: id of the job - `COZY_JOB_MANUAL_EXECUTION`: whether the job was started manually (in Home) or automatically (via a cron trigger or event) The konnector process can send events trough its stdout (newline separated JSON object), the konnector worker pass these events to the realtime hub as io.cozy.jobs.events . Only JSON formatted events are forwarded to the client-side throught realtime Otherwise formatted lines (such as node Error) will be kept in some system logs. Konnectors should NOT log the received account login values in production. Konnector error handling The konnector can output json formated messages as stated before (the events) and those events will be typed and formatted like this: { type : messagetype , // can be debug , info , warning , error , and critical message : message // can be any string } If there is an error or critical message, the execution will be seen as a failure by cozy-stack. It s also the case if the konnector reaches the timeout or returns with a non-zero status code. Note: debug and info level are not transmitted to syslog, except if the instance is in debug mode. It would be too verbose to do otherwise. Account deleted When an account is deleted, or a konnector is going to be uninstalled, the konnector is executed with the account_deleted field to true, so it can clean the account remotely. OAuth (and service secrets) Doctypes io.cozy.konnectors gives their desiderata for an account { fields : { account : { doctype : io.cozy.accounts , account_type : maif , scope : openid profile offline_access } } } io.cozy.accounts contains authentication information for an account, as well as the associated scope { name : Mon Compte Maif , account_type : maif , status : connected , oauth : { access_token : akosaksoakso , refresh_token : okoakozkaozk , scope : openid profile offline_access } } io.cozy.account_types contains the oauth configuration: { _id : service.example , grant_mode : authorization_code , client_id : the registered client id , client_secret : client_secret is necessary for server-flow , auth_endpoint : https://service.example/auth , token_endpoint : https://api.service.example/token } io.cozy.account_types are not accessible to the applications: they are injected directly in CouchDB in a global database secrets/io-cozy-accounts_type . Secrets that are not OAuth The io.cozy.account_types doctype can also be used for storing secrets that are not related to OAuth. The document still need to be injected manually in secrets/io-cozy-accounts_type : { _id : service.example , grant_mode : secret , slug : service , secret : th1$_1$_th3_s3cr3t! } Note : grant_mode must be secret , slug must be the slug of the konnector, but secret can be a map instead of a simple string if several secrets are needed for this service. The secret is given to the konnector in the COZY_PARAMETERS env variable. Reminder OAuth flow Service is the website from which konnector aims to retrieve informations. Stack is the cozy stack. OAuth is divided in 3 steps: Client Registration: the client application (the Stack) needs to be registered with the Service Obtaining Refreshing Authorization: all the steps from client_id to access_token , the Stack will handle those Using the access_token : ideally, the konnector should only concern itself with this part; it receives an access_token and uses it. Client Registration Before beginning the Grant process, most Services require the application to be registered with a defined redirect_uri . There are a lot of options, which we will choose from when actually implementing konnectors using them. Manually Most services requires a human developer to create the client manually and define its redirect_uri. However each instance has its own domain, so for these services, we will need to: A. Register a proxy client , which is a static page performing redirections as needed, as was done for Facebook events in v2 konnectors. We will register a well known cozy domain, like oauth-proxy.cozy.io and registers it with all providers. The use and risks associated with this domain should be made clear to the user. B. Register each Stack with a redirect_uri on the main stack domain, if we go this way, the register_uri below moves from bob.cozy.rocks/accounts/redirect to oauthcallback.cozy.rocks/redirect and the domain will be prepended to the state. This is feasible at cozy scale, but requires more knowledge and work for self-hosters. Example: Google For example, these are the steps for creating the google account_type for the stack at .mycozy.cloud: Go to https://console.developers.google.com Select or Create Project (up left near the logo) Enable desired APIs (TBD with usages) Click Credentials Create credentials Oauth Client ID Web application Set redirectURI to https://oauthcallback.mycozy.cloud/accounts/google/redirect Copy and paste provided Client ID and Client Secret. Then save the data in the console http PUT localhost:5984/secrets%2Fio-cozy-account_types/google grant_mode=authorization_code redirect_uri= https://oauthcallback.mycozy.cloud/accounts/google/redirect token_mode=basic token_endpoint= https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token auth_endpoint= https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth client_id=$CLIENT_ID client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRET Dynamic Registration Protocol A few services allows client to register programaticaly through the Dynamic Client Registration Protocol RFC7591 , we should allow the Stack to register using this protocol when we first need to implement a Konnector connecting to such a Service. No redirect_url enforcement A few services allows to specify arbitrary redirect_url without registering beforehand as a client. Authorization Grant flows webserver flow (Authorization Code Grant) A. In the cozy app (Home) give a link a href = https://bob.cozy.rocks/accounts/service-name/start? scope=photos state=1234zyx NOTE the scope may depends on other fields being configured (checkboxes), this will be described in json in the konnectors manifest. The format will be determined upon implementation. NOTE To limit bandwidth and risk of state corruption, the cozy app should save its state under a random key into localStorage, the key is then passed as the state in this query. B. Service lets the user login, allows or denies the scope, then redirects to https://oauthcallback.cozy.rocks/accounts/service-name/redirect? code=AUTH_CODE_HERE state=1234zyx C. The Stack does Server side this request: POST https://api.service.example/oauth/access_token HTTP / 1.1 Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded grant_type=authorization_code code=AUTH_CODE_HERE redirect_uri=https://oauthcallback.cozy.rocks/accounts/service-name/redirect client_id=CLIENT_ID client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET D. The Service responds (server side) with: { access_token : ACCESS_TOKEN , token_type : bearer , expires_in : 2592000 , refresh_token : REFRESH_TOKEN , scope : read , uid : 100101 , info : { name : Claude Douillet , email : claude.douillet@example.com } } This whole object is saved as-is into a io.cozy.accounts s extras field. The known fields access_token , refresh_token scope will be also saved on the account s oauth itself E. The Stack redirect the user to the cozy app: HTTP / 1.1 302 Found Location : https://bob-home.cozy.rocks/?state=1234zyx account=accountID The Cozy app checks that the state is expected, and restores its state to the form but whith account completed. SPA flow (Implicit grant) A. The cozy app gives a link: a href = https://service.example/auth? (url) response_type=token client_id=CLIENT_ID redirect_uri=https://bob-home.cozy.rocks/ scope=photos state=1234zyx See server-flow for state rules. B. Service lets the user login, allows or denies the scope, then redirects to https://bob-home.cozy.rocks/? access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN state=1234zyx C. The Cozy app adds the token to the io.cozy.accounts and save it before starting konnector. Accessing data Once we have an account, the Cozy app starts the konnector with the proper account id. The konnector can then fetch the account and use its access_token to performs a request to fetch data: POST https://api.service.com/resource HTTP / 1.1 Authorization : Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN Refreshing token When using the server-flow, we also get a refresh_token. It is used to get a new access_token when it expires. However, if konnectors are responsible for refreshing token there is a race condition risk : (konnector A) GET https://api.service.com/resource TOKEN1 - expired (konnector B) GET https://api.service.com/resource TOKEN1 - expired (konnector A) POST https://api.service.com/token REFRESH_TOKEN - TOKEN2a (konnector B) POST https://api.service.com/token REFRESH_TOKEN - TOKEN2b (konnector A) GET https://api.service.com/token TOKEN2a - invalid To avoid this, the stack will be responsible to perform token refresh. A konnector can requires the stack to refresh an account token with an HTTP request. POST https://bob.cozy.rocks/accounts/:accountID/refresh HTTP / 1.1 Konnectors Marketplace Requirements The following is a few points to be careful for in konnectors when we start allowing non-cozy developped OAuth konnectors. With SPA flow, because of advanced security concerns (confused deputy problem), cozy should validate the access_token . However, the way to do that depends on the provider and cannot be described in json, it is therefore the responsibility of the konnector itself. Account types security rules With server flow, an evil account type with proper auth_endpoint but bad token_endpoint could retrieve a valid token as well as cozy client secret. The reviewer of an account_type should make sure both these endpoints are on domains belonging to the Service provider. Notes for MesInfos experiment MAIF konnector uses the webserver flow without redirect_uri validation Orange konnector uses the client-side proxy but hosted on their own servers (/!\\ redirect_uri vs redirect_url)","title":"Workflow of the konnectors"},{"location":"cozy-stack/konnectors-workflow/#konnectors-workflow","text":"","title":"Konnectors workflow"},{"location":"cozy-stack/konnectors-workflow/#tldr","text":"","title":"TL;DR"},{"location":"cozy-stack/konnectors-workflow/#types","text":"","title":"Types"},{"location":"cozy-stack/konnectors-workflow/#accounts","text":"io.cozy.accounts contains information for an account, including those for authentication (technically, they are encrypted by cozy-stack before being saved in CouchDB, but we will show them as the konnectors will see them): { auth : { login : 000000000 , password : ********** }, folderPath : /Administratif/Free Mobile , label : freemobile , namePath : Free Mobile } Accounts are manipulated through the /data/ API.","title":"Accounts"},{"location":"cozy-stack/konnectors-workflow/#aggregator-accounts","text":"Some konnectors are based on an aggregator service.

The permissions are used when a request is made to cozy stack. It allows to let the owner of the cozy instance controls the access to her data, files and actions on them. The permissions are given in several contexts. Let s see them! Client-side apps When the user installs a new client-side app, she is asked to accept an initial set of permissions for this app. This set of permissions is described in the manifest of the app. Later, the application can gain more permissions via the intents and optional permissions. See below for more details. When the authentified user access a client-side app, the app receives a token from the stack that can be used in later requests to the stack as a proof of the permissions it owns. External apps via OAuth2 An external application can ask for permissions via the OAuth2 dance, and use them later with the access token. The permissions are in the scope parameter. Sharing with other users The owner of a cozy instance can share some documents and files with other users. It can be done in two ways: If the other user also has a cozy, it can be a cozy-to-cozy sharing. Else, the owner can give to him a link with a code or a shortcode. What is a permission? A permission gives the right for a request having it to do something on the stack. It is defined by four components. Type type is the attribute used in JSON-API or the docType for the Data System. It is the only mandatory component. If just the type is specified, it gives access to all the operations on this type . For example, a permission on type io.cozy.contacts gives the right to create, read, update and delete any contact, and to fetch all the contacts. A permission on type io.cozy.files allow to access and modify any file or directory. Some known types: io.cozy.files , for files and folder in the VFS io.cozy.apps , for apps io.cozy.settings , for the settings io.cozy.jobs and io.cozy.triggers , for jobs io.cozy.oauth.clients , to list and revoke OAuth 2 clients Verbs It says which HTTP verbs can be used for requests to the cozy-stack. GET will give read-only access, DELETE can be used for deletions, etc. Verbs should be declared in a list, like [\"GET\", \"POST\", \"DELETE\"] , and use [\"ALL\"] as a shortcut for [\"GET\", \"POST\", \"PUT\", \"PATCH\", \"DELETE\"] (it is the default). Note : HEAD is implicitely implied when GET is allowed. OPTIONS for Cross-Origin Resources Sharing is always allowed, the stack does not have the informations about the permission when it answers the request. Values It s possible to restrict the permissions to only some documents of a docType, or to just some files and folders. You can give a list of ids in values . Note : a permission for a folder also gives permissions with same verbs for files and folders inside it. Selector By default, the values are checked with the id . But it s possible to use a selector to filter on another field . In particular, it can be used for sharing. A user may share a calendar and all the events inside it. It will be done with two permissions. The first one is for the calendar: { type : io.cozy.calendars , verbs : [ GET ], values : [ 1355812c-d41e-11e6-8467-53be4648e3ad ] } And the other is for the events inside the calendar: { type : io.cozy.events , verbs : [ GET ], selector : calendar-id , values : [ 1355812c-d41e-11e6-8467-53be4648e3ad ] } What format for a permission? JSON The prefered format for permissions is JSON. Each permission is a map with the type , verbs , values and selector see above, plus a description that can be used to give more informations to the user. Only the type field is mandatory. In the manifest, the permissions are regrouped in a map. The key is not very relevant, it s just here for localization. The same key is used in the locales field to identify the permission. Example: { permissions : { contacts : { description : Required for autocompletion on @name , type : io.cozy.contacts , verbs : [ GET ] }, images : { description : Required for the background , type : io.cozy.files , verbs : [ GET , POST ], values : [ io.cozy.files.music-dir ] }, mail : { description : Required to send a congratulations email to your friends , type : io.cozy.jobs , selector : worker , values : [ sendmail ] } } } Inline OAuth2 as a scope parameter for defining the permissions given to the application. But it s only a string, not a JSON. In that case, we use a space delimited list of permissions, each permission is written compactly with : between the components. Example: io.cozy.contacts io.cozy.files:GET:io.cozy.files.music-dir io.cozy.jobs:POST:sendmail:worker Note : the verbs component can t be omitted when the values and selector are used.

It can also associates one or more codes to it, via the codes parameter in the query string. These codes can then be sent to other people as a way to give these permissions (sharing by links). For each code created, a corresponding shortcode is generated and can be used to shorten links for sharing. The code parameter is a comma separed list of values. The role of these values is to identify the codes if you want to revoke some of them later. A ttl parameter can also be given to make the codes expires after a delay ( bigduration format ).

Most of them will come from couchdb, some jobs and user actions might also trigger them. Events feed: the feed of occurring events. There is two types of feeds: continuous allows to follow events as they occurs interval allow the see the history of the feed from any given time Realtime: user experienced updates of the interface from change happening from another source. Ie, I have a folder opened in cozy-files on the browser, I take some pictures from my smartphone, the pictures appears in the folder without me needing to refresh the browser tab. What couchdb offers Couchdb supports with its _changes API both events feeds types: using since=now continuous=true we get all events continuous ly as they happen (SSE) using since=(last known seq_number) we get all changes in the interval between last known seq_number and now. Couchdb also offers a _db_updates route, which give us continuous changes at the database level. This routes does not support a since parameter, as there is no global seq_number . Other events will be generated from the stack itself, such as session close or jobs activity. Performance limitation We cannot have a continuous _changes feed open to every databases Use cases for interval events feeds Replication Couchdb replication algorithm can work in one-shot mode, where it replicates changes since last sync up until now, or in continuous mode where it replicates changes as they happens. The stack will not allow continuous mode for replication. This is already supported with the _changes route Sharing Our sharing is based on couchdb replication rules, so also depends on _changes feed to ensure all changes have been applied. Considering these use cases, there is no need for non-couchdb event to be part of the interval events feed. Use cases for continuous events feeds Realtime Some events should be send to the client to update views as data change. @event jobs trigger Some event will trigger the activation of a job (ie. When a photo has been uploaded, generate thumbnails and extract EXIF metadatas). This should be done as soon as possible after the events Sharing ? While not absolutely necessary, having cozy A notify cozy B when a shared document is changed allows for both better user experience (faster propagation) and better performance (no need to poll every X minutes, the N cozy we are sharing from). Client realtime tech choice Options Polling: regularly ask the server what happened since last time. COMET: Leaving a normal HTTP connection open sending data and heartbeets regularly to keep it open, reading xhr.responseText at intervals without waiting for readyState == 4. Restart the connection when it breaks. SSE: Normalized standardized version of COMET with half-decent browser support (86% users) but easily polyfillable (it s just COMET). It is simpler and easier to debug. It has some limitations (no HTTP headers in JS api, counts toward the maximum number of http connection per domain). Websocket: keep a socket open, it allows 2 way data communication which we do not need, has better server support (92% users) but is impossible to polyfill client side, more popular, there is a better golang package SockJS cie they are a lot of packages which imitate Websocket API while using complicated client server polyfill to allow support of older browser. SockJS is a drop-in websocket replacement with a go package and javascript client. Choice = Websocket While SSE appears at first glance like a better fit for our use case, its limitation and lack of browser priority makes us choose websocket. In the event older browser supports becomes necessary we can use SockJS. optimization paths (future) bandwidth Limiting the number of events sent by allowing the client to specified it is only interested in events matching a selector (files app only care about changes in the files of the current folder view) number of connections Instead of 1 socket / tab, we can probably make 1 socket / browser using some hackish combination of SharedWorker / iframe.postMessage and a client-side demultiplexer. both No need for realtime if the user is not using the tab (for most usecases), we could cut the realtime feed depending on Page Visibility API Go/Stack architecture We assume all couchdb changes will originate from the stack Events are generated at the stack level We do NOT rely on couchdb _changes?continuous nor _db_udpates We create a realtime.Event interface, which we call in other packages. We accept websocket connection and bind them to a realtime.Dispatcher object. Small cozy version It all happens in RAM, realtime.Event are immediately transmited to the dispatcher. Big cozy version (ie. multiple stack instance) Redis pub/sub Websocket API We start with a normal websocket handshake. Websockets include a protocol description in handshake, the protocol described below is hereby named io.cozy.websocket .

Cozy applications can use data from the Data System and files from the Virtual File System. Of course, sometimes a link between data and files can be useful. For example, the application can have an album with photos. The album will be a document in CouchDB (with a title and other fields), but il will also list the files to use as photos. A direct way to do that is storing the files IDs in the album document. It s simple and will work pretty well if the files are manipulated only from this application. But, files are often accessed from other apps, like cozy-desktop and cozy-drive. To improve the User eXperience, it should be nice to alert the user when a file in an album is modified or deleted. When a file is modified, we can offer the user the choice between keeping the original version in the album, or using the new modified file. When a file is moved to the trash, we can alert the user and let him/her restore the file. Cozy-desktop, cozy-drive, and the other apps can t scan all the documents with many different doctypes to find all the references to a file to detect such cases. The goal of this document is to offer a way to do that, and it is called References .

Channels We differentiate three channels of release for each application: stable: for stable releases beta: for application that can be tested in advance dev: for the latest releases directly from the trunk of the repository For each of these channels, the version string has a different format which differentiate the version channel: stable: X.Y.Z where X , Y and Z are positive or null integers. beta: X.Y.Z-beta.M where X , Y , Z and M are positive or null integers dev: X.Y.Z-dev.checksum where X , Y and Z are positive or null integers and checksum is a unique identifier of the dev release (typically a shasum of the git commit) Version order TLDR: 1.0.0-dev._ 1.0.0 and 1.0.0-beta._ 1.0.0 , make sure you upgrade your app version after publishing stable. The order used to determine the latest version of a channel is the following: - `1.0.0-dev.* lt; 1.0.0 (dev lt; stable)` - `1.0.0-beta.* lt; 1.0.0 (beta lt; stable)` - `1.0.0-beta.1 lt; 1.0.0-beta.2` To order beta and dev releases, we apply a sort by their creation date. Objects Two types of objects are managed in the registry: applications and versions. Application An application described a specific package. It is linked to multiple versions (releases) of the application. An application object is mutable . An application object contains the following fields: slug : the application slug (unique) type : the application type ( webapp or konnector ) editor : the application editor name versions : an object containing all the channels versions latest_version : the latest available version maintenance_activated : boolean, true when the maintenance mode is activated on the application maintenance_options : present only if maintenance_activated is true, object with the following fields: flag_infra_maintenance : bool, true iff the maintenance is internal to the cozy infrastructure flag_short_maintenance : bool, true iff the maintenance is a short maintenance, waiting for a correction on our side flag_disallow_manual_exec : bool, true iff the maintenance will disallow the execution on the application, even when manually executed messages : a list of localized messages containing a short and long information messages explaining the maintenance state label : integer for a confidence grade from 0 to 5 (A to F), labelling the application from a user privacy standpoint. It is calculated from the data_usage_commitment and data_usage_commitment_by fields. data_usage_commitment : specify a technical commitment from the application editor: user_ciphered : technical commitment that the user s data is encrypted and can only be known by him. user_reserved : commitment that the data is only used for the user, to directly offer its service. none : no commitment data_usage_commitment_by : specify what entity is taking the commitment: cozy : the commitment is taken by cozy editor : the commitment is taken by the application s editor none : no commitment is taken Example: { slug : drive , type : webapp , editor : cozy , versions : { stable : [ 3.1.1 ], beta : [ 3.1.1-beta.1 ], dev : [ 3.1.1-dev.7a8354f74b50d7beead7719252a18ed45f55d070 ] }, latest_version : { /* */ } } Version A version object describe a specific release of an application. A version object is immutable . An application version object contains the following fields: slug : the application slug type : the application type (webapp, konnector, ) manifest : the entire manifest defined in the package created_at : date of the release creation url : URL of the tarball containing the application at specified version size : the size of the application package (uncompressed) in bytes as string sha256 : the sha256 checksum of the application content tar_prefix : optional tar prefix directory specified to properly extract the application content The version string should follow the channels rule. Example: { slug : drive , type : webapp , version : 3.1.2 , created_at : 2017-07-05T07:54:40.982Z , url : http://.../3.1.2 , size : 1000 , sha256 : 466aa0815926fdbf33fda523af2b9bf34520906ffbb9bf512ddf20df2992a46f , manifest : { /* ... */ }, maintenance_activated : true , maintenance_options : { flag_infra_maintenance : true , flag_short_maintenance : false , flag_disallow_manual_exec : true , messages : { en : { long_message : The app is currently in maintenance because of .... , short_message : The app is currently in maintenance }, fr : { long_message : L application est en cours de maintenance \u00e0 cause de ... , short_message : L application est en cours de maintenance } } } } APIs: Adding to registry These APIs can be used to add elements to the registry. POST /registry/:app This route adds or modify an application to the registry. The content of the request should be a json object of an application. Status codes 201 Created, when the application has been successfully added 409 Conflict, when an application with the same slug already exists 400 Bad request, if the given application data is malformed (bad slug, missing editor, ) Request POST /registry/drive HTTP / 1.1 Authorization : Token AbCdE { slug : drive , editor : cozy , name : { en : Drive , fr : Drive }, description : { en : The drive application }, repository : https://github.com/cozy/cozy-drive , tags : [ foo , bar , baz ] } POST /registry/:app/:version or POST /registry/:app/versions This route adds a version of an application to the registry to the specified channel (stable, beta or dev). The content of the manifest file extracted from the application data is used to fill the fields of the version. Before adding the application version to the registry, the registry should check the following: the manifest file contained in the tarball should be checked and have its fields checked against the application properties the application content should check the sha256 checksum Fields of the object sent to this request: url : the url where the application tarball is stored sha256 : the sha256 checksum of the tarball version : the version value (should match the one in the manifest) parameters? : an optional json value (any) that will override the parameters field of the manifest icon? : an optional path to override the icon field of the manifest screenshots? : and optional array of path to override the screenshots field of the manifest Status codes 201 Created, when the version has been successfully added to the registry 409 Conflict, when the version already exists 404 Not Found, when the application does not exist 412 Precondition Failed, when the sent application data is invalid (could not fetch data URL, bad checksum, bad manifest in the tarball ) 400 Bad request, when the request is invalid (bad checksum encoding, bad URL ) Request Request to add a stable release: POST /registry/drive/3.1.2 HTTP / 1.1 Authorization : Token AbCdE { version : 3.1.2 , url : https://github.com/cozy/cozy-drive/archive/v3.1.2.tar.gz , sha256 : 466aa0815926fdbf33fda523af2b9bf34520906ffbb9bf512ddf20df2992a46f } Request to add a development release: POST /registry/drive/3.1.2-dev.7a1618dff78ba445650f266bbe334cbc9176f03a HTTP / 1.1 Authorization : Token AbCdE { version : 3.1.2-dev.7a1618dff78ba445650f266bbe334cbc9176f03a , url : https://github.com/cozy/cozy-photos-v3/archive/7a1618dff78ba445650f266bbe334cbc9176f03a.zip , sha256 : 466aa0815926fdbf33fda523af2b9bf34520906ffbb9bf512ddf20df2992a46f } Request to add a version with optional parameters: POST /registry/drive/3.1.2 HTTP / 1.1 Authorization : Token AbCdE { version : 3.1.2 , url : https://github.com/cozy/cozy-photos-v3/archive/7a1618dff78ba445650f266bbe334cbc9176f03a.zip , sha256 : 466aa0815926fdbf33fda523af2b9bf34520906ffbb9bf512ddf20df2992a46f , parameters : { foo : bar , baz : 123 } } Response HTTP / 1.1 201 Created Content-Type : application/json Location : http://.../3.1.2 { slug : drive , type : webapp , version : 3.1.2-dev.7a1618dff78ba445650f266bbe334cbc9176f03a , created_at : 2017-07-05T07:54:40.982Z , url : http://.../7a1618dff78ba445650f266bbe334cbc9176f03a.zip , size : 1000 , sha256 : 466aa0815926fdbf33fda523af2b9bf34520906ffbb9bf512ddf20df2992a46f , manifest : { /* ... */ } } APIs: Querying registry These routes define the querying part of a registry to access to the available applications and versions.

This namespace can contain a list of URL for the different registries attached to the stack. The stack itself implements the querying API of a registry. When querying this API, to ask for an application, the stack uses this hierarchy of registries to proxy or redirect the user. The hierarchy can also be contextualised to specify different registries to different contexts. The default context is applied lastly. Examples: registries : - https://myregistry.home/ - https://main.registry.cozy.io/ # In this example, a context1 instance will have the equivalent of the # following list of registries: # # - https://context1.registry.cozy.io/ # - https://myregistry.home/ # - https://registry.cozy.io/ # registries : context1 : - https://context1.registry.cozy.io/ context2 : - https://context2.registry.cozy.io/ default : - https://myregistry.home/ - https://registry.cozy.io/ Authentication The authentication is based on a token that allow you to publish applications and versions with for one specific editor name.

Technically, it is made with the Content Security Policy. These rules are very strict and it would be a pity to now allow a client side app to load public informations from a source like Wikipedia. Our proposal is to make client side apps able to query external websites of their choices, but these requests will be made via the cozy-stack (as a proxy) and will be logged to check later that no personal data was leaked unintentionally. We can see the data loaded from the external website as a document with a doctype: it s just not a doctype local to our cozy, but a remote one. A client side app can request data from external websites by doing these three steps: Declaring a remote doctype and its requests Declaring permissions on these doctypes in the manifest Calling the /remote API of cozy-stack Declaring a remote doctype Doctypes are formalized in this repository: github.com/cozy/cozy-doctypes . Each doctype has its own directory inside the repository. For a remote doctype, it will include a file called request that will describe how the cozy-stack will request the external website. Let s take an example: $ tree cozy-doctypes cozy-doctypes \u251c\u2500\u2500 [ ... ] \u251c\u2500\u2500 org.wikidata.entity \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 request \u2514\u2500\u2500 org.wikidata.search \u2514\u2500\u2500 request $ cat cozy-doctypes/org.wikidata.entity/request GET https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/ {{ entity }} .json Accept: application/json $ cat cozy-doctypes/org.wikidata.search/request GET https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php?action = wbsearchentities search ={{ q }} language = en format = json Here, we have two remote doctypes. Each one has a request defined for it. The format for the request file is: the verb and the URL on the first line then some lines that describe the HTTP headers then a blank line and the body if the request is a POST For the path, the query-string, the headers, and the body, it s possible to have some dynamic part by using {{ , a variable name, and }} . Some templating helpers are available to escape specific variables using {{ function name - space - variable name }} . These helpers are only available for the body part of the template. Available helpers: json : for json parts ( { \"key\": \"{{json val}}\" } ) html : for html parts ( p {{html val}} /p ) query : for query parameter of a url ( http://foobar.com?q={{query q}} ) path : for path component of a url ( http://foobar.com/{{path p}} ) Values injected in the URL are automatically URI-escaped based on the part they are included in: namely as a query parameter or as a path component. Note : by default, the User-Agent is set to a default value ( cozy-stack and a version number). It can be overriden in the request description. Example: GET https://foobar.com/ {{ path }} ?q= {{ query }} Content-Type: {{ contentType }} { key : {{ json value }} , url : http://anotherurl.com/ {{ path anotherPath }} ?q= {{ query anotherQuery }} , } Declaring permissions Nothing special here. The client side app must declare that it will use these doctypes in its manifest, like for other doctypes: { ... : ... , permissions : { search : { description : Required for searching on wikidata , type : org.wikidata.search }, entity : { description : Required for getting more informations about an entity on wikidata , type : org.wikidata.entity } } } Calling the remote API GET/POST /remote/:doctype The client side app must use the same verb as the defined request ( GET in our two previous examples). It can use the query-string for GET, and a JSON body for POST, to give values for the variables. Example: GET /remote/org.wikidata.search?q=Douglas+Adams HTTP / 1.1 Host : alice.cozy.tools It is possible to send some extra informations, to make it easier to understand the request. If no variable in the request matches it, it won t be send to the remote website. Example: POST /remote/org.example HTTP / 1.1 Host : alice.cozy.tools Content-Type : application/json { query : Qbhtynf Nqnzf , comment : query is rot13 for Douglas Adams } Note : currently, only the response with a content-type that is an image, JSON or XML are accepted. Other content-types are blocked the time to evaluate if they are useful and their security implication (javascript is probably not something we want to allow). GET /remote/assets/:asset-name The client application can fetch a list of predefined assets via this route. The resources available are defined in the configuration file. Example: GET /remote/assets/bank HTTP / 1.1 Host : alice.cozy.tools Logs The requests are logged as the io.cozy.remote.requests doctype, with the doctype asked, the parameter (even those that have not been used, like comment in the previous example), and the application that has made the request. For developers If you are a developer and you want to use a new remote doctype, it can be difficult to first make it available in the github.com/cozy/cozy-doctypes repository and only then test it. So, the cozy-stack serve command will have a --doctypes option to gives a local directory with the doctypes. You can fork the repository, clone it, work on a new doctype inside, test it locally, and when OK, make a pull request for it.","title":"/remote - Proxy for remote data/API"},{"location":"cozy-stack/remote/#proxy-for-remote-dataapi","text":"The client side applications in Cozy are constrained and cannot speak with external websites to avoid leaking personal data.

Each one has a request defined for it. The format for the request file is: the verb and the URL on the first line then some lines that describe the HTTP headers then a blank line and the body if the request is a POST For the path, the query-string, the headers, and the body, it s possible to have some dynamic part by using {{ , a variable name, and }} . Some templating helpers are available to escape specific variables using {{ function name - space - variable name }} . These helpers are only available for the body part of the template. Available helpers: json : for json parts ( { \"key\": \"{{json val}}\" } ) html : for html parts ( p {{html val}} /p ) query : for query parameter of a url ( http://foobar.com?q={{query q}} ) path : for path component of a url ( http://foobar.com/{{path p}} ) Values injected in the URL are automatically URI-escaped based on the part they are included in: namely as a query parameter or as a path component. Note : by default, the User-Agent is set to a default value ( cozy-stack and a version number). It can be overriden in the request description. Example: GET https://foobar.com/ {{ path }} ?q= {{ query }} Content-Type: {{ contentType }} { key : {{ json value }} , url : http://anotherurl.com/ {{ path anotherPath }} ?q= {{ query anotherQuery }} , }","title":"Declaring a remote doctype"},{"location":"cozy-stack/remote/#declaring-permissions","text":"Nothing special here.

Engineers have a tendancy to overestimate the technical risks and underestimate the human interactions. It doesn t mean that we can avoid technical measures. But it s very important to take in account the possible behaviour of the user. That means that adding a text to explain him/her the consequences of a click on a button can increase the security a lot much than forcing him/her to do things. For example, forcing users to change regulary their password makes them choose passwords that are a lot weaker (but easier for them to remember). Defense in depth is still worthy Also known as layered defense, defense in depth is a security principle where single points of complete compromise are eliminated or mitigated by the incorporation of a series or multiple layers of security safeguards and risk-mitigation countermeasures. Have diverse defensive strategies, so that if one layer of defense turns out to be inadequate, another layer of defense will hopefully prevent a full breach. Have a strict control of all the accesses to the Cozy All the requests to the cozy stack have a strict access control. It is based on several informations: Is the user connected? What is the application that makes this request? What are the permissions for this application? Which grant is used, in particular for applications with public pages? What are the permissions for this grant? More informations here . Protect client-side apps by default This is mostly applying the state of the art: Using HTTPS, with HSTS. Using secure, httpOnly, sameSite cookies to avoid cookies theft or misuse. Using a Content Security Policy (CSP). Using X-frame-options http header to protect against click-jacking. But we will use a CSP very restrictive by default (no access to other web domains for example). Don t trust inputs, always sanitize them If we take the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities , we can see that a lot of them are related to trusting inputs. It starts with the first one, injections, but it goes also to XSS and unvalidated forwards (in OAuth2 notably). Always sanitizing inputs is a good pratice that improves security, but has also some nice effects like helping developers discover hidden bugs. Encryption is not the solution to all the problems, but it helps Some data are encrypted before being saved in CouchDB (passwords for the accounts for example). Encrypting everything has some downsides: It s not possible to index encryped documents or do computations on the encrypted fields in reasonable time ( homomorphic encryption is still an open subject). Having more encrypted data can globally weaken the encryption, if it s not handled properly. If the encryption key is lost or a bug happen, the data is lost with no way to recover them. So, we are more confortable to encrypt only some fields. And later, when we will have more experience and feedbacks from the user, extend the encryption to more fields. We are also working with SMIS , a research lab, to find a way to securely store and backup the encryption keys. Use standards (https, OAuth2) Standards like https and OAuth2 had a lot of eyes to look at them, and are therefore more robust. Reinventing the wheel can be valuable for some things. But for security, the cost is very high and only some very particular constraints can justify such an high cost. Cozy don t have these constraints, so we will stick to the standards. Have a reliable way to deploy, with sane defaults It s important that deploying a cozy is well documented, doesn t require too many steps and can be automatized. An error on the installation can have dramatic effects, like the database being leaked on internet. So, we need to really take care of the devops experience.

A user can preview a sharing before accepting it if the application supports this option. Else, he/she will have only the description and rules to make his/her mind about accepting or refusing the sharing. The data is duplicated: it is both on the owner s cozy, and on the recipients cozy (no cloud federation like NextCloud). The applications say what is shared, the stack synchronizes that. The stack does the low-level stuff and gives primitives to the applications. The applications must use them in a responsible manner, and in particular, to avoid transitivity issues. The CouchDB replication will be used to synchronize the documents. It means that the documents will be same on the owner and on the recipients ( symetric sharing ). For files and folders, the replicator will be customized to handle the specificities of the io.cozy.files doctype. The applications must be able to work with broken relationships between documents. The applications should know how to deal with CouchDB conflicts. At least, the default choice of a winner for conflicts by CouchDB should be acceptable if the applications don t do anything to detect and resolve conflicts. First safety principle: when a user B accepts a sharing from user A, the documents that were on the user B s cozy before the sharing are not sent to user A without an explicit action of user B (like moving a file to a shared directory). Second safety principle: when two users, A and B, are sharing documents, a change of a document on the user A s cozy can t make an exiting document of user B enter in the sharing. Setup of a sharing Step 1: the owner creates the sharing One person decides to share something with other people from an application on her cozy. In our example, Alice wants to share a todo list with her friends, Bob and Charlie, and it is done from the Todo application. The application calls the stack with the rules for this sharing and the identifiers of the contacts with whom to share. The stack persists an io.cozy.sharings document and sends an email to the recipients (Bob an Charlie). Step 2: a recipient accepts the sharing A recipient, let\u2019s say Bob, receives the email and clicks on the link. His browser shows him the Todo application on Alice\u2019s Cozy so that he can preview the todo list, and a modal asks him if he wants to continue the sharing acceptation workflow. If he does, a form will ask him what is the address of his Cozy (the form can be pre-filled if he has already accepted another sharing in the past). After he has filled the form and submitted it, he is redirected on his Cozy. If he is not logged in, he has to login first. Then, a page describes him how the sharing will work and what technical permissions it implies. It also asks him to confirm the sharing. If he accepts, his instance will send to Alice\u2019s instance the answer. Step 3: the initial replication starts Alice\u2019s Cozy instance creates token and sends them with other informations as the response of the answer request from Bob\u2019s instance. At this moment, both instances are ready to start to replicate data to the other instances. So, let\u2019s do the initial replication. Alice\u2019s instance starts to fill the io.cozy.shared database with all the documents that match a rule of the sharing (except the rules with local: true ), and create triggers for the future documents to be also added in this database (the exact triggers depend of the parameters of the rules). And, when done, it creates a job for the replicator, and setups a trigger for future changes in the io.cozy.shared start a replicator job. Bob\u2019s instance also checks if any document matches a sharing rule. In most cases, it won\u2019t. But in some very special cases (e.g. a previous revoked sharing on the same documents), there are some documents that match a rule. They are added to the io.cozy.shared database, but with a conflict flag. They won\u2019t be replicated unless Bob accepts to in his Todo application. Triggers are also added on Bob\u2019s instance for filling the io.cozy.shared database, and to call the replicator after that. Note: there will be a lock around the initial filling of the io.cozy.shared database to avoid concurrency issues if two recipients accept the sharing at the same time. Workflow Step 1: a todo item is added on Bob\u2019s Cozy, a trigger is fired and it adds the new document to the io.cozy.shared database Step 2: a debounced trigger on the io.cozy.shared database is used to start a replicator Step 3: the replicator does the following steps it queries a local document of the io.cozy.shared database to get the last sequence number of a successful replication with this sequence number, it requests the changes feed of io.cozy.shared with a filter on the sharing id the results is a list of document doctype + id + rev that is sent to Alice\u2019s Cozy Alice\u2019s Cozy checks which revisions are known, and send a response with the list of those that are not for each not known revision, Bob\u2019s Cozy send the document to Alice\u2019s Cozy (in bulk) and, if it\u2019s all good, it persists the new sequence number in the local document, as a start point for the next replication Step 4: the changes are put in the io.cozy.shared database on Alice\u2019s Cozy Step 5: it starts a replicator on Alice\u2019s Cozy Step 6: the replicator send the changes to Charlie\u2019s Cozy, all the cozy instances are synchronized again! Note: when a todo item is moved fron a shared todo list to a not shared todo list, the document in io.cozy.shared for the todo item is kept, and the sharing id is associated to the keyword removed inside it. The remove behavior of the sharing rule is then applied. Files and folders Why are they special? Files are special for several reasons. First and foremost, they have a binary attached to them that can be quite heavy. The stack also enforces some rules on them (e.g. a file can\u2019t be added to a deleted folder) and has some specific code for the tree nature of files and folders (e.g. a permission on a folder is inherited on all the files and folders inside it, even if they are several levels below). Thus, the workflow explained just before is not compatible with the files. As we need to introduce some code specific to the files, we have also wanted to improve the sharing of files. First, we don\u2019t want to force the recipients to put the shared folder at exactly the same place as the owner. In fact, we think that putting the shared folder in a folder called Shared with me is more friendly. We also think that a file that has been shared in the past but is no longer (the sharing has been revoked) can evolve on both the owner\u2019s cozy and on the recipients\u2019 cozy in different ways, and in such a case, it\u2019s more logical to consider them as different files. These two reasons implies, on a technical level, that the identifiers for files and folders are not the same on the owner and the recipients of a sharing. The replicator will translate the identifiers from one system to another during the replications. Of course, it will also translate the id in the sharing rules, and the dir_id to preserve the relationship between a file and its parent folder. The path attribute will be seen as a cache, and recomputed when a cozy instance receives a folder document from a sharing replication. We will continue to have a replication as close to the CouchDB replication as possible. It means we synchronize a state, and not looking for the history of operations like cozy-desktop does. It is less accurate and can lead more often to conflicts. The cozy instances are expected to be online most of the time and have a short delay for replications: we think that the conflicts will happen only on rares occasions. This make acceptable to take this shortcut. And, in case of conflicts, we will preserve the content of the files (no data loss), even if it means duplicating the files. How a sharing involving files works? When a sharing involves a rule on the io.cozy.files doctype, a folder is created on the recipients cozy where the files will be put. It is created inside the Shared with me folder by default, but can be moved somewhere else after that. The folder won\u2019t be synchronized its-self later, and if the folder is trashed, the sharing is automatically revoked. As it is not a reversible action, a confirmation is asked before doing that. Note: we will forbid the sharing of the root of the virtual file system, of the trash and trashed files/folders, and of the Shared with me folder. The step 3 described above, aka the replicator, will be more complicated for folders and files. First change, it will work on two phases: 1. what can be synchronized without transfering the binaries first, and 2. the synchronization of files with a binary attached. Second change, the replicator will acquire the Virtual File System lock on the cozy instance where it will write things to ensure the consistency of what it writes. Third change, before inserting a folder or file in the database, the replicator checks that its parent exists, and if it\u2019s not the case, it creates it. Last change, we will avoid CouchDB conflicts for files and folder by using a special conflict resolution process. Sequence diagram Conflict resolution We have several cases of conflicts: When two cozy instances have modified the same file concurrently Same for a folder When two files or folders are renamed concurrently to the same name inside the same directory When a file or folder is created or updated on cozy instance while the parent directory is trashed concurrently on another cozy instance. For 1. and 2., we will reconciliate the changes except for a file with two versions having a distinct binary (we rely on size and checksum to detect that). In such a case, we create a copy of the file with one version, while keeping the other version in the original file. For 3., we rename the file or folder with the smaller id . For 4., we restore the trashed parent, or recreate it if it the trash was emptied. Conflict with no reconciliation When a file is modified concurrently on two cozy instances, and at least one change involve the content, we can t reconciliate the modifications. To know which version of the file is the winner and will keep the same identifier, and which version is the loser and will have a new identifier, we compare the revisions and the higher wins. This conflict is particulary tricky to resolve, with a lot of subcases. In particular, we try to converge to the same revisions on all the instances for the winner file (and for the loser too). We have 3 sets of attributes for files: size and md5sum (they change when the content has changed) name and dir_id (they change when the file is moved or renamed) created_at , updated_at , tags , referenced_by , etc. For the first two sets, the operation on the Virtual File System will needs to reach the storage (Swift), not just CouchDB. For the third set, it s easy: we can do the change at the same time as another change, because these attributes are only used in CouchDB. But we can t do a change on the first two sets at the same time: the Virtual File System can t update the content and move/rename a file in the same operation. If we needs to do both, it will generate 2 revisions in CouchDB for the file. Note: you can see that using CouchDB-like replication protocol means that we have some replications that can look useless, just some echo to a writing. In fact, it is used to acknowledge the writing and is helpful for conflict resolutions. It may be conter-intuitive, but removing them will harm the stability of the system, even if they do nothing most of the time. Example 1 Here, Alice uploads a file on her Cozy. It creates two revisions for this file (it s what the Virtual File System does). Then, she shares the directory with this file to her friend Bob. When Bob accepts the sharing, the file is sent to his Cozy, with the same revision (2-2aa). Later, Bob renames the file. It creates a new revision (3-3aa). The change is replicated to Alice s Cozy. And we have a replication from Alice to Bob to ensure that every thing is fine. Even later, Alice and Bob both renames the file at the same time. It creates a conflict. We have a first replication (from Alice to Bob), but nothing happens on B because the local revision (4-4bb) is greater than the candidate revision (4-4aa) and the content is the same. Just after that, we have a revision on the opposite direction (from Bob to Alice). The candidate revision wins (4-4bb), but for files, we don t use CouchDB conflict, thus it s not possible to write a new revision at the same generation (4). The only option is to create a new revision (5-5bb). This revision is then sent to Bob: Bob s Cozy accepts the new revision even if it has no effect on the file (it was already the good name), just to resolve the conflict. Example 2 Like in the last example, Alice uploads a file and share a directory to Bob with this file, Bob acccepts. But then, several actions are made on the file in a short lapse of time and it generates a difficult conflict: Alice renames the file, and then uploads a new version with cozy-desktop Bob moves the file to a sub-directory. So, when the replication comes, we have two versions of the file with different name, parent directory, and content. The winner is the higher revision (4-4aa). The resolution takes 4 steps: A copy of the file is created from the revision 3-3bb, with the new identifier id2 = XorID(id, 3-3bb). The new content is written on Bob s Cozy: we can t use the revisions 3-3aa (same generation as 3-3bb) and 4-4aa (it will mean the conflict is fixed, but it s not the case, the filenames are still different), so a new revision is used (4-4cc).

Schema Description of a sharing An identifier (the same for all members of the sharing) A list of members . The first one is the owner. For each member, we have the URL of the cozy, a contact name, a public name, an email, a status, a read-only flag, and some credentials to authorize the transfer of data between the owner and the recipients A description (one sentence that will help people understand what is shared and why) a flag active that says if the sharing is currently active for at least one member a flag owner , true for the document on the cozy of the sharer, and false on the other cozy instance a flag open_sharing : true if any member of the sharing except the read-only ones can add a new recipient false if only the owner can add a new recipient Some technical data ( created_at , updated_at , app_slug , preview_path , triggers , credentials ) a number of files to synchronize for the initial sync, initial_number_of_files_to_sync (if there are no files to sync or the initial replication has finished, the field won t be here) A list of sharing rules , each rule being composed of: a title , that will be displayed to the recipients before they accept the sharing a doctype a selector (by default, it\u2019s the id ) and values (one identifier, a list of identifiers, files and folders inside a folder, files that are referenced by the same document, documents bound to a previous sharing rule) local : by default false , but it can be true for documents that are useful for the preview page but doesn\u2019t need to be send to the recipients (e.g. a setting document of the application) add : a behavior when a new document matches this rule (the document is created, or it was a document that didn\u2019t match the rule and is modified and the new version matches the rule): none : the updates are never propagated (the default) push : the updates made on the owner are sent to the recipients sync : the updates on any member (except the read-only) are propagated to the other members update : a behavior when a document matched by this rule is modified. Can be: none : the updates are never propagated (the default) push : the updates made on the owner are sent to the recipients sync : the updates on any member (except the read-only) are propagated to the other members remove : a behavior when a document no longer matches this rule (the document is deleted, or it was a document that matched the rule, and is modified and the new version doesn\u2019t match the rule): none : the updates are never propagated (the default) push : the updates made on the owner are sent to the recipients sync : the updates on any member (except the read-only) are propagated to the other members revoke : the sharing is revoked.

A user can preview a sharing before accepting it if the application supports this option. Else, he/she will have only the description and rules to make his/her mind about accepting or refusing the sharing. The data is duplicated: it is both on the owner s cozy, and on the recipients cozy (no cloud federation like NextCloud). The applications say what is shared, the stack synchronizes that. The stack does the low-level stuff and gives primitives to the applications. The applications must use them in a responsible manner, and in particular, to avoid transitivity issues. The CouchDB replication will be used to synchronize the documents. It means that the documents will be same on the owner and on the recipients ( symetric sharing ). For files and folders, the replicator will be customized to handle the specificities of the io.cozy.files doctype. The applications must be able to work with broken relationships between documents. The applications should know how to deal with CouchDB conflicts. At least, the default choice of a winner for conflicts by CouchDB should be acceptable if the applications don t do anything to detect and resolve conflicts. First safety principle: when a user B accepts a sharing from user A, the documents that were on the user B s cozy before the sharing are not sent to user A without an explicit action of user B (like moving a file to a shared directory). Second safety principle: when two users, A and B, are sharing documents, a change of a document on the user A s cozy can t make an exiting document of user B enter in the sharing.","title":"Hypothesis"},{"location":"cozy-stack/sharing-design/#setup-of-a-sharing","text":"","title":"Setup of a sharing"},{"location":"cozy-stack/sharing-design/#step-1-the-owner-creates-the-sharing","text":"One person decides to share something with other people from an application on her cozy.

First and foremost, they have a binary attached to them that can be quite heavy. The stack also enforces some rules on them (e.g. a file can\u2019t be added to a deleted folder) and has some specific code for the tree nature of files and folders (e.g. a permission on a folder is inherited on all the files and folders inside it, even if they are several levels below). Thus, the workflow explained just before is not compatible with the files. As we need to introduce some code specific to the files, we have also wanted to improve the sharing of files. First, we don\u2019t want to force the recipients to put the shared folder at exactly the same place as the owner. In fact, we think that putting the shared folder in a folder called Shared with me is more friendly. We also think that a file that has been shared in the past but is no longer (the sharing has been revoked) can evolve on both the owner\u2019s cozy and on the recipients\u2019 cozy in different ways, and in such a case, it\u2019s more logical to consider them as different files. These two reasons implies, on a technical level, that the identifiers for files and folders are not the same on the owner and the recipients of a sharing. The replicator will translate the identifiers from one system to another during the replications. Of course, it will also translate the id in the sharing rules, and the dir_id to preserve the relationship between a file and its parent folder. The path attribute will be seen as a cache, and recomputed when a cozy instance receives a folder document from a sharing replication. We will continue to have a replication as close to the CouchDB replication as possible. It means we synchronize a state, and not looking for the history of operations like cozy-desktop does. It is less accurate and can lead more often to conflicts. The cozy instances are expected to be online most of the time and have a short delay for replications: we think that the conflicts will happen only on rares occasions. This make acceptable to take this shortcut. And, in case of conflicts, we will preserve the content of the files (no data loss), even if it means duplicating the files.","title":"Why are they special?"},{"location":"cozy-stack/sharing-design/#how-a-sharing-involving-files-works","text":"When a sharing involves a rule on the io.cozy.files doctype, a folder is created on the recipients cozy where the files will be put. It is created inside the Shared with me folder by default, but can be moved somewhere else after that. The folder won\u2019t be synchronized its-self later, and if the folder is trashed, the sharing is automatically revoked. As it is not a reversible action, a confirmation is asked before doing that. Note: we will forbid the sharing of the root of the virtual file system, of the trash and trashed files/folders, and of the Shared with me folder. The step 3 described above, aka the replicator, will be more complicated for folders and files. First change, it will work on two phases: 1. what can be synchronized without transfering the binaries first, and 2. the synchronization of files with a binary attached. Second change, the replicator will acquire the Virtual File System lock on the cozy instance where it will write things to ensure the consistency of what it writes. Third change, before inserting a folder or file in the database, the replicator checks that its parent exists, and if it\u2019s not the case, it creates it.

For 1. and 2., we will reconciliate the changes except for a file with two versions having a distinct binary (we rely on size and checksum to detect that). In such a case, we create a copy of the file with one version, while keeping the other version in the original file. For 3., we rename the file or folder with the smaller id . For 4., we restore the trashed parent, or recreate it if it the trash was emptied.","title":"Conflict resolution"},{"location":"cozy-stack/sharing-design/#conflict-with-no-reconciliation","text":"When a file is modified concurrently on two cozy instances, and at least one change involve the content, we can t reconciliate the modifications. To know which version of the file is the winner and will keep the same identifier, and which version is the loser and will have a new identifier, we compare the revisions and the higher wins. This conflict is particulary tricky to resolve, with a lot of subcases. In particular, we try to converge to the same revisions on all the instances for the winner file (and for the loser too). We have 3 sets of attributes for files: size and md5sum (they change when the content has changed) name and dir_id (they change when the file is moved or renamed) created_at , updated_at , tags , referenced_by , etc. For the first two sets, the operation on the Virtual File System will needs to reach the storage (Swift), not just CouchDB. For the third set, it s easy: we can do the change at the same time as another change, because these attributes are only used in CouchDB. But we can t do a change on the first two sets at the same time: the Virtual File System can t update the content and move/rename a file in the same operation. If we needs to do both, it will generate 2 revisions in CouchDB for the file. Note: you can see that using CouchDB-like replication protocol means that we have some replications that can look useless, just some echo to a writing. In fact, it is used to acknowledge the writing and is helpful for conflict resolutions. It may be conter-intuitive, but removing them will harm the stability of the system, even if they do nothing most of the time.","title":"Conflict with no reconciliation"},{"location":"cozy-stack/sharing-design/#example-1","text":"Here, Alice uploads a file on her Cozy.

And we have a replication from Alice to Bob to ensure that every thing is fine. Even later, Alice and Bob both renames the file at the same time. It creates a conflict. We have a first replication (from Alice to Bob), but nothing happens on B because the local revision (4-4bb) is greater than the candidate revision (4-4aa) and the content is the same. Just after that, we have a revision on the opposite direction (from Bob to Alice). The candidate revision wins (4-4bb), but for files, we don t use CouchDB conflict, thus it s not possible to write a new revision at the same generation (4).

Sharing by links A client-side application can propose sharing by links: The application must have a public route in its manifest. See Apps documentation for how to do that. The application can create a set of permissions for the shared documents, with codes. Another code called shortcode is also generated and associated with the code. This shortcode is much smaller (but secure), which is easier to be shared. See permissions documentation for the details. The application can then create a shareable link (e.g. https://calendar.cozy.example.net/public?sharecode=eiJ3iepoaihohz1Y ) by putting together the app sub-domain, the public route path, and a code for the permissions set. The app can then send this link by mail, via the jobs system , or just give it to the user, so he can transmit it to her friends via chat or other ways. When someone opens the shared link, the stack will load the public route, find the corresponding index.html file, and replace {{.Token}} inside it by a token with the same set of permissions that sharecode offers. This token can then be used as a Bearer token in the Authorization header for requests to the stack (or via cozy-client-js). NB: The shortcode can also be used as the Bearer . In this case, the corresponding sharecode will be matched on server-side If necessary, the application can list the permissions for the token by calling /permissions/self with this token. Cozy to cozy sharing The owner of a cozy instance can send and synchronize documents to others cozy users. Intents When a sharing is authorized, the user is redirected to their cozy on the application that was used for the sharing (when possible). It s possible to use a specific route to do so, via the intents. The application must declare an intent in its manifest for the action SHARING .

The event is similar to a realtime event: a verb, a document, and optionaly the old version of this document. Share-replicate and share-upload The message is composed of a sharing ID and a count of the number of errors (i.e. the number of times this job was retried). migrations The migrations worker can be used to migrate a cozy instance that has its files in swift from a V1 or V2 layout to a V3 layout.

Cozy Stack Architecture What is Cozy? Cozy is a personal platform as a service with a focus on data. Cozy can be seen as 4 layers, from inside to outside: A place to keep your personal data A core API to handle the data Your web apps, and also the mobile desktop clients A coherent User Experience. It s also a set of values: Simple, Versatile, Yours. These values mean a lot for Cozy in all aspects. From an architectural point of view, it declines to: Simple to deploy and understand, not built as a galaxy of optimized microservices managed by kubernetes that only experts can debug. Versatile, can be hosted on a Raspberry Pi for geeks to massive scale on multiple servers by specialized hosting. Users can install apps. Yours, you own your data and you control it. If you want to take back your data to go elsewhere, you can. Overview The architecture of Cozy is composed of: A reverse proxy The cozy stack A CouchDB instance to persist the JSON documents A space for storing files Optionally, Redis for caching and synchronization Optionally, a metrics server. All of this can run on a personal server, self-hosted at home, like a Raspberry Pi: But it s also possible to deploy a cozy on a more powerful server in order to host dozens of cozy instances (an association for example). It will looks like this: And even to scale to thousands of cozy instances on a server farm, with high availability: This elasticity comes with some constraints: Most applications are run in the browser, not in the server. What must run on the server is mutualized inside the cozy stack. The cozy stack is stateless. The data is stored in couchdb and a space for files. A couchdb database is specific to an instance (no mix of data from 2 users in the same database). Reverse proxy The reverse proxy is here to accept HTTPS connexions and forward the request to the cozy stack. It s here mainly to manage the TLS part and binding a port 1024 without needing to launch the cozy stack as root. And it s better if http/2 is supported, as it will make the web interface to load faster. The Cozy Stack The Cozy Stack is a single executable. It can do several things but its most important usage is starting an HTTP server to serve as an API for all the services of Cozy, from authentication to real-time events. This API can be used on several domains. Each domain is a cozy instance for a specific user ( multi-tenant ). Redis Redis is optional when there is a single cozy stack running. When available, it is used to synchronize the Cozy Stacks: distributed locks for special operations like installing an application, queues for recurrent jobs, etc. As a bonus, it can also be used to cache some frequently used documents. Databases The JSON documents that represent the users data are stored in CouchDB, but they are not mixed in a single database. We don t mix data from 2 users in the same database. It s easier and safer to control the access to the data by using different databases per user. But we think to go even further by splitting the data of a user in several databases, one per document type. For example, we can have a database for the emails of a user and one for her todo list. This can simplify the implementation of permissions (this app has access to these document types) and can improve performance. CouchDB queries work with views. A view is defined ahead of its usage and is built by CouchDB when it is requested and is stale, i.e. there were writes in the database since the last time it was updated. So, with a single database per user, it s possible to experience lag when the todolist view is requested after fetching a long list of emails. By splitting the databases per doctypes, we gain on two fronts: The views are updated less frequently, only when documents of the matching doctypes are written. Some views are no longer necessary: those to access documents of a specific doctypes. There are downsides, mostly: It can be harder to manage more databases. It s no longer possible to use a single view for documents from doctypes that are no longer in the same database. We think that we can work on that and the pros will outweigh the cons. Metrics The Cozy Stack can generate some metrics about its usage (the size of the files transfered, the number of opened connexions, the number of requests to redis, etc.) and export them to a metrics backend. It will help identify the bottlenecks when scaling to add more users. The Warp 10 Platform looks like a good candidate for this. Glossary Instance An instance is a logical space owned by a user and identified by a domain. For example, zoe.cozycloud.cc can be the cozy instance of Zo\u00e9. This instance has a space for storing files and some CouchDB databases for storing the documents of its owner. Environment When creating an instance, it s possible to give an environment, dev , test or prod . The default apps won t be the same on all environments. For example, in the dev environment, some devtools will be installed to help the front developers to create their own apps. Cozy Stack Build Mode The cozy stack can run in several modes, set by a UNIX environment variable: production , the default development , for coding on the cozy stack. This mode is set when compiling the cozy-stack. It is used to show more or less logs, and what is acceptable to be displayed in errors. Even if the Cozy Stack Build Mode and Environment have similar values, they are not the same. The Cozy Stack Mode will be used by core developers to hack on the cozy stack. The environment will be used by front developers to hack on cozy apps. Services The cozy stack came with several services. They run on the server, inside the golang process and have an HTTP interface. Authentication /auth The cozy stack can authenticate the owner of a cozy instance. This can happen in the classical web style, with a form and a cookie, but also with OAuth2 for remote interactions like cozy-mobile and cozy-desktop. Applications /apps It s possible to manage serverless applications from the cozy stack and serve them via cozy stack. The stack does the routing and serve the HTML and the assets for the applications. The assets of the applications are installed in the virtual file system. On the big instances, it means that even if it is the frontal 1 that installs the application, frontal 2 will still be able to serve the application by getting its assets from Swift. It will be possible to install applications from several sources (git, mercurial, npm or even just a tarball). Also, we want to offer two channels for our official apps: one with a stable and well tested release, and one with more frequent updates for our more adventurous users. More informations here . Data System /data CouchDB is used for persistence of JSON documents. The data service is a layer on top of it for routing the requests to the corresponding CouchDB database and checking the permissions. In particular, a serverless application can declare some contexts and access data in those contexts even if it s not the owner of the cozy instance that access it. For example, the owner of a cozy can create a photo album with a selection of photos. This album can then be associated to a context to be shared with friends of the owner. These friends can access the album and see the photos, but not anonymous people. More informations here . Virtual File System /files It s possible to store files on the cozy, including binary ones like photos and movies, thanks to the virtual file system. It s a facade, with several implementations, depending on where the files are effectively stored: In a directory of a local file system (easier for self-hosted users) Swift from Open Stack (convenient for massive hosting) And more storage providers, like minio , later. The range of possible operations with this endpoint goes from simple ones, like uploading a file, to more complex ones, like renaming a folder. It also ensure that an instance is not exceeding its quota, and keeps a trash to recover files recently deleted. More informations here . Sharing /sharings Users will want to share things like calendars. This service is there for sharing JSON documents between cozy instances, with respect to the access control. Jobs /jobs The cozy stack has queues where job descriptions can be put. For example, a job can be to fetch the latest bills from a specific provider. These queues can be consumed by external workers to complete the associated jobs. We can imagine having a media worker that extract thumbnails from photos and videos. It will fetch jobs from a media queue and each job description will contain the path to the photo or video from which the thumbnail will be extracted. There is also a scheduler that acts like a crontab. It can add jobs at recurrent time. For example, it can add a job for fetching github commits every hour. Later, we can dream about having more ways to create jobs (webhooks, on document creation) and make them communicate. With a web interface on that, it can become a simplified Ifttt . Sync /sync This endpoint will be for synchronizing your contacts and calendars by using standard methods like caldav and carddav. Later, we hope to support also Webdav and RemoteStorage. Settings /settings Each cozy instance has some settings, like its domain name, its language, the name of its owner, the background for the home, etc. Notifications /notifications The applications can put some notifications for the user. That goes from a reminder for a meeting in 10 minutes to a suggestion to update your app. Real-time /realtime This endpoint can be used to subscribe for real-time events. An application that shows items of a specific doctype can listen for this doctype to be notified of all the changes for this doctype. For example, the calendar app can listen for all the events and if a synchronization with the mobile adds a new event, the app will be notified and can show this new event. Error catcher /errors Client-side applications can have some JS errors. By sending the error, with its backtrace, to this endpoint, it will be kept in a logfile to help the developers debug the application later. We should look at the airbrake API and probably be compatible with it to avoid redeveloping JS code to send the errors. Proxy /proxy It can be useful for client-side apps to get data from public APIs. But, sometimes, these APIs don t have CORS enabled. A proxy endpoint can be a simple but effective solution for these cases. Status /status It s here just to say that the API is up and that it can access the CouchDB databases, for debugging and monitoring purposes. Workers The workers take jobs from the queues and process them. Fetch emails /jobs/mailbox It fetches a mailbox to synchronize it and see if there are some new emails. Payload: the mailbox Send email /jobs/sendmail It connects to the SMTP server to send an email. Payload: mail account, recipient, body, attachments Extract metadata /jobs/metadata When a file is added or updated, this worker will extract its metadata (EXIF for an image, id3 for a music, etc.) Payload: the filepath Konnectors /jobs/konnector It synchronizes an account on a remote service (fetch bills for example). Payload: the kind of konnector, the credentials of the account and some optional parameters (like the folder where to put the files) Registry /jobs/registry It updates the list of available applications. Payload: none Indexer /jobs/indexer When a JSON document is added, updated or deleted, this worker will update the index for full text search. Bleve looks like a good candidate for the indexing and full text search technology. Payload: the doctype and the document to index Serverless apps Home /apps/home It s where you land on your cozy and launch your apps. Having widgets to display informations would be nice too! Store (was marketplace) /apps/store You can install new apps here. Settings (was My apps) /apps/settings It s a list of your installed apps and devices, and you can configure some settings like your email address. Collect (was konnectors) /apps/collect You can configure new accounts, to fetch data from them, and see the already configured accounts. Devtools /apps/devtools Some tools for the developpers of applications only: an API console, documentation, logs of the permission checks, etc. Contacts /apps/contacts Manage your contact books. Calendar /apps/calendar Manage your events and alarms. Drive /apps/drive A web interface to browse your files. Photos /apps/photos Organize your photos and share them with friends. Todo list /apps/todo A task manager to never forgot what you should do. Onboarding /apps/onboarding Start your cozy and setup your accounts. Clients Mobile Cozy-mobile is an application for android and iOS for synchronizing files, contacts and calendars between the phone and the cozy instance. Desktop Cozy-desktop is a client for Linux, OSX and windows that allows to sync the files in a cozy instance with a laptop or desktop. Guidelines The Go Programming Language Go (often referred as golang) is an open source programming language created at Google in 2007. It has nice properties for our usage: Simplicity (the language can be learned in weeks, not years). A focus on productivity. Good performance. A good support of concurrency with channels and goroutines. Moreover, Go is used by a lot of companies , is in the Top 10 of the most used languages and has some known open source projects: docker, kubernetes, grafana, syncthing, influxdb, caddy, etc. And it works on the ARM platforms . Go has some tools to help the developers to format its code ( go fmt ), retrieve and install external packages ( go get ), display documentation ( godoc ), check for potential errors with static analysis ( go vet ), etc. Most of them can be used via gometalinter , which is nice for continuous integration. So, we think that writing the Cozy Stack in Go is the right choice. Repository organisation \u251c\u2500\u2500 assets The assets for the front-end \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 images The images \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts The javascript files \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 styles The CSS files \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 templates The HTML templates \u251c\u2500\u2500 cmd One .go file for each command of the cozy executable \u251c\u2500\u2500 docs Documentation, including this file \u251c\u2500\u2500 pkg One sub-directory for each golang package \u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts Some shell scripts for developers and testing \u2514\u2500\u2500 web One sub-directory for each of the services listed above Rest API We follow the best practices about Rest API (using the right status codes, HTTP verbs, organise code by resources, use content-negociation, etc.). When known standards make sense (caldav carddav for example), use them. Else, JSON API is a good default. The golang web framework used for the cozy stack is Echo . HTTP status codes There are some HTTP status codes that are generally used in the API: 200 OK, when everything is OK 201 Created, when a resource was created 204 No Content, when a resource was deleted 400 Bad Request, when the request has some unknown parameters and the request body is not in the expected format 401 Unauthorized, when the user is not authenticated 403 Forbidden, when the permissions forbid this action 404 Not Found, when the resouce can t be found 500 Internal Server Error, when a bug occurs 503 Service Unavailable, when the stack, CouchDB, Redis or Swift is unavailable. DocTypes Each JSON document saved in CouchDB has a field docType that identify the kind of thing it is. For example, a contact will have the docType io.cozy.contacts , and in the cozy-doctypes repository, there will be a contacts JSON file inside it that describes this doctype: What are the mandatory and optional fields? What is the type (string, integer, date) of the fields? Is there a validation rule for a field? How the fields can be indexed for full text search? What is the role of each field (documentation)? This description can be used by any cozy client library (JS, Golang, etc.) to generate some models to simplify the use of documents of this doctype. When a docType has a lot of logic (calendar events for example), a JS class should be shared between the several client-side apps that use this docType, in order to avoid recoding this logic in each application. Import and export You will stay because you can leave. An important promise of Cozy is to give back to the users the control of their data. And this promise is not complete with a way to export the data to use it somewhere else. The Cozy Stack will offer an export button that gives a tarball to the user with the full data. She can then import it on another instance for example. It should also be possible to use the data outside of Cozy. So, the format for the tarball should be as simple as possible and be documented. Of course, when it s possible, we will use open formats. How to contribute? Cozy s DNA is fundamentally Open Source and we want our community to thrive. Having contributions (code, design, translations) is important for us and we will try to create the favorable conditions to support it. Adding a new konnector Adding a konnector is easy for someone who knows JavaScript. The repository has already a lot of pull requests by external contributors. The wiki has documentation to explain the first steps of creating a new konnector. 3 active contributors have been promoted to the maintainers team and can merge the pull requests. We have done workshops to help new developers code their first konnector and we will keep doing it. Creating a new application One of the goals of the new architecture is to make it easier for developers to write new apps. It means having a good documentation, but also some devtools to help: The cozy executable will have a command to setup a new project. The devtools on the cozy interface will give documentation about the doctypes, help explore the Rest API, and check if the permissions are OK. cozy-ui will make it easy to reuse some widgets and offer an application with a style coherent to the cozy identity. Some docTypes with heavy logic will be available as JS classes to be reused in the apps. Reporting a bug or suggesting a new feature We are listening to our users. The forum is here to discuss on many subjects, including how the applications are used. The issues on github are a good place for bug tracking. Translating to a new language We will keep having internationalization for our applications and the translations are maintained on transifex by the community. Translating to a new language, or reviewing an existing one, is really appreciated. FAQ Does the current konnectors in nodejs will be lost? No, they won t. The business logic to scrap data from the many sources will be kept and they will be adapted to fit in this new architecture. It is explained how we will do that here . So, it s not possible to have a custom application with a server part, like the lounge IRC client? We want to support this use case, just not on the short term. It s not clear how we can do that (while not weakening the security). One idea is to run the applications in a different server, or maybe in docker. How to install and update cozy? The Cozy Stack will have no auto-update mechanism. For installing and updating it, you can use the classical ways: Using a package manager, like apt for debian ubuntu. Using an official image for Raspberry Pi (and other embedded platforms). Using the image and services of an hosting company. Or compiling and installing it manually if you are really brave ;-) How to add a cozy instance to a farm? Choose a (sub-)domain and configure the DNS for this (sub-)domain. Configure the reverse-proxy to accept this (sub-)domain. Use the cozy executable to configure the cozy stack. How to migrate from the nodejs cozy to this new architecture for cozy? Export the data from the nodejs cozy (we need to add a button in the web interface for that in the coming months). Install the new cozy. Import the data. Please note that we don t support a continuous replication method that will enable to use both the nodejs and the new architecture at the same time. It looks too complicated for a temporary thing. How to backup the data? There are 2 sensitive places with data: In CouchDB. on the place used for the Virtual File System (a directory on the local filesystem, or in Swift). You can use the tools of your choice to backup these 2 locations. The good old rsync works fine (CouchDB files are append-only, except when compaction happens, so it s friendly to rsync). It s highly recommended to have an automated backup, but sometimes it can be useful to have a way to backup manually the data. The export data button in the web interface give a tarball that can be used to transfer your data from one instance to another, and so, it can be used as a backup. Aren t microservices better for scaling? Yes, it s often easier to scale by separating concerns, and microservices is a way to achieve that. But, it has some serious downsides: It takes more memory and it s probably a no-go for Raspberry Pi. It s more complicated for a developper to install the whole stack before coding its application. It s harder to deploy in production. For the scalability, we can also deploy some specialized instances of the Cozy Stack. For example, we can have some Cozy Stack processes dedicated for real-time. Even, if they have all the code, we can route only the relevant trafic from the load-balancer. What are the frameworks and tools used for the front-end apps? If you want to develop your own app, you can use the framework and the tools you like, nothing is mandatory. For the official apps, we will want to move to: es2017 (but converting the existing coffeescript code will take time) npm scripts and webpack preact JSX. More about this here When will this new architecture be available?

No, they won t. The business logic to scrap data from the many sources will be kept and they will be adapted to fit in this new architecture. It is explained how we will do that here . So, it s not possible to have a custom application with a server part, like the lounge IRC client? We want to support this use case, just not on the short term. It s not clear how we can do that (while not weakening the security). One idea is to run the applications in a different server, or maybe in docker. How to install and update cozy? The Cozy Stack will have no auto-update mechanism. For installing and updating it, you can use the classical ways: Using a package manager, like apt for debian ubuntu. Using an official image for Raspberry Pi (and other embedded platforms). Using the image and services of an hosting company. Or compiling and installing it manually if you are really brave ;-) How to add a cozy instance to a farm? Choose a (sub-)domain and configure the DNS for this (sub-)domain. Configure the reverse-proxy to accept this (sub-)domain. Use the cozy executable to configure the cozy stack. How to migrate from the nodejs cozy to this new architecture for cozy? Export the data from the nodejs cozy (we need to add a button in the web interface for that in the coming months). Install the new cozy. Import the data. Please note that we don t support a continuous replication method that will enable to use both the nodejs and the new architecture at the same time. It looks too complicated for a temporary thing. How to backup the data? There are 2 sensitive places with data: In CouchDB. on the place used for the Virtual File System (a directory on the local filesystem, or in Swift). You can use the tools of your choice to backup these 2 locations. The good old rsync works fine (CouchDB files are append-only, except when compaction happens, so it s friendly to rsync). It s highly recommended to have an automated backup, but sometimes it can be useful to have a way to backup manually the data. The export data button in the web interface give a tarball that can be used to transfer your data from one instance to another, and so, it can be used as a backup. Aren t microservices better for scaling? Yes, it s often easier to scale by separating concerns, and microservices is a way to achieve that. But, it has some serious downsides: It takes more memory and it s probably a no-go for Raspberry Pi. It s more complicated for a developper to install the whole stack before coding its application. It s harder to deploy in production. For the scalability, we can also deploy some specialized instances of the Cozy Stack. For example, we can have some Cozy Stack processes dedicated for real-time. Even, if they have all the code, we can route only the relevant trafic from the load-balancer. What are the frameworks and tools used for the front-end apps? If you want to develop your own app, you can use the framework and the tools you like, nothing is mandatory. For the official apps, we will want to move to: es2017 (but converting the existing coffeescript code will take time) npm scripts and webpack preact JSX.

Konnectors :warning: Note: this documentation is outdated. It is kept for historical reasons and shows the design and trade-offs we have made initially. But a lot of things have changed since, so don t expect the things to be still the same. What we want ? Konnectors is an application for Cozy v2 that fetch data from different web sites and services, and save them into a Cozy. The 50+ connectors represent a lot of work from the community. So, we want to port it to Cozy v3. There will be 2 parts: My Accounts, a client-side app, that will offer the possibility for the user to configure her accounts, and choose when to start the import of data (see the architecture doc ). Konnectors, a worker for the job service , with the code to import data from the web sites. Security The risks Konnectors is not just a random application. It s a very good target for attacks on Cozy because of these specificities: It run on the server, where there is no Content Security Policy, or firewall to protect the stack. It has access to Internet, by design. It is written in nodejs, with a lot of dependencies where it is easy to hide malicious code. It is a collection of connectors written by a lot of people. We welcome these contributions, but it also means that we take into account that we can t review in depth all the contributions. Access to couchdb The stack has the admin credentials of couchdb. If a rogue code can read its configuration file or intercept connexions between the stack and couchdb, it will have access to couchdb with the admin credentials, and can do anything on couchdb. Access to the stack An attacker can try to profit of konnectors for accessing the stack. It can target the port 6060, used by the stack to manage the cozy instances. Or, it can use its privileged position for timing attacks on passwords. Spying other connectors A rogue connector may try to spy other connectors to pick the credentials for external web sites. It can be done by reading the environment variables or ptracing them. DoS A connector can use a lot of CPU, Ram, or generate a lot of disk I/O to make a deny of service on the server. The connector can remove files on the server to make konnectors stop working. Exploiting the CPU or the bandwidth The resources of the server can be seen as valuable: the CPU can be used for bitcoins mining. The bandwidth can be used for DDoS of an external target. Sending spam Profit of the configured SMTP server to send spams. Be root Row hammer can be a way to gain root access on a server. Possible measures Permissions We can forbid the konnectors to speak directly with couchdb, and pass by the stack for that. And use the permissions to restrict what each konnectors can do with the cozy-stack. ignore-scripts for npm/yarn Npm and yarn can execute scripts defined in package.json when installing nodejs dependencies. We can use the ignore-scripts option to disable this behaviour. Forbid addons in nodejs Nodejs can require addons , ie C/C++ compiled libraries. I ve found no flag to disable the install of such modules for npm/yarn, and no flag for nodejs to prevent loading them. We can try to detect and remove such modules just after the installation of node modules. They should have a .node extension. Note : not having a compiler on the server is not enough. Npm can install precompiled modules. vm/sandbox for Nodejs vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with whitelisted Node s built-in modules. Mock net We can mock the net module of nodejs to add some restrictions on what it can do. For example, we can check that it does only http/https, and blacklist connection to localhost:6060. It is only effective if the konnector has no way to start a new node processus. Timeout If a konnector takes too long, after a timeout, it should be killed. It implies that the cozy-stacks supervises the konnectors. Chroot Chroot is a UNIX syscall that makes an application see only a part of the file-system. In particular, we can remove access to /proc and /sys by not mounting them, and limit access to /dev to just /dev/null , /dev/zero , and /dev/random by symlinks them. Executing as another user We can create UNIX users that will just serve to execute the konnectors, and nothing else. It s a nice way to give more isolation, but it means that we have to find a way to execute the konnectors: either run the cozy-stack as root, or have a daemon that launches the konnectors. Ulimit Prlimit ulimit provides control over the resources available to the shell and to processes started by it, on systems that allow such control. It can be used to linit the number of processes (protection against fork bombs), or the memory that can be used. prlimit can do the same for just one command (technically, for a new session, not the current one). Linux namespaces One feature Linux provides here is namespaces. There are a bunch of different kinds: in a pid namespace you become PID 1 and then your children are other processes. All the other programs are gone in a networking namespace you can run programs on any port you want without it conflicting with what\u2019s already running in a mount namespace you can mount and unmount filesystems without it affecting the host filesystem. So you can have a totally different set of devices mounted (usually less). It turns out that making namespaces is totally easy! You can just run a program called unshare . Source: What even is a container, by Julia Evans Cgroups cgroups (abbreviated from control groups) is a Linux kernel feature that limits, accounts for, and isolates the resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, etc.) of a collection of processes. Seccomp BPF Seccomp BPF is an extension to seccomp that allows filtering of system calls using a configurable policy implemented using Berkeley Packet Filter rules. Isolation in a docker Isode is a 3 years old project that aims to isolate nodejs apps in docker containers. A possibility would be to follow this path and isolate the konnectors inside docker. It s a real burden for administrators. And its command line options often changes from one version to another, making difficult to deploy something reliable for self-hosted users. So we will try to avoid it. Isolation in docker contains is mostly a combination of Linux Namespaces, Cgroups, and Seccomp BPF. There are other options with those (see below). Rkt Rkt is a security-minded, standard-based container engine. It is similar to Docker, but Docker needs running a daemon whereas rkt can be launched from command-line with no daemon. NsJail / FireJail NsJail and FireJail are two tools that use Linux Namespaces and Seccomp BPF to reduce the risks to run untrusted applications on Linux. FireJail seems to be more suited for graphical apps, and NsJail for networking services. NaCl / ZeroVM ZeroVM is an open source virtualization technology that is based on the Chromium Native Client (NaCl) project. ZeroVM creates a secure and isolated execution environment which can run a single thread or application. But NaCl is no longer maintained and ZeroVM has some severe limitations, so, it won t be used. Konnector isolation study The short list of tools which will be tested to isolate connectors is Rkt and NsJail which on paper better fullfill our needs. NsJail NsJail is a lightweight process isolation tool, making use of Linux namespaces and seccomp-bpf syscall filters. It is not a container tool like docker. Its features are quite extensive regarding isolation. The README gives the full list of available options. Although available in the google github, it is not an official google tool. NsJail is: easy to install : just a make away with standard build tools offers a full list or isolation tools lightly documented the only documentation is nsjail -h (also available in the main github page) and it is quite cryptic for a non-sysadmin like me. I could not find any help in any search engine. Some examples are available to run a back in an isolated process and work but I could not run a full nodejs (only nodejs -v worked) The konnectors will need a full nodejs installed on the host Is still actively maintained Rkt Rkt is very similar to docker. It can even directly run docker images from the docker registry, which gives us a lot of existing images to use, even if we want to be able to use other languages than node. For example, we could have also a container dedicated to weboob, another container could use phantomjs or casper and without forcing self-hosted users to do complicated installation procedures. Rkt is : easy to install : debian, rpm package available, archlinux community package : https://github.com/coreos/rkt/releases has network isolation like docker offers CPU, memory limitation, seccomp isolation (but the set of rules to use is out of my understanding) is well documented , complete man pages, but not as well known as docker, then there is not a lot of things to find outside the official documentation. can use docker image directly or can convert them to one runnable aci file with one simple cli command (rkt export) is in active developpement but relatively stable regarding core features. container images can be easily signed and the signature is checked by default when running a container. I managed to run a nodejs container with just the following commands : rkt run --insecure-options=image --interactive docker://node:slim --name nodeslim -- -v rkt list # to get the container uuid rkt export --app=nodeslim lt;uuid gt; nodeslim.aci rkt run --insecure-options=image --interactive nodeslim.aci -- -v # to run node -v in the new container Note: the insecure-options param is to avoid the check of the image signature to ease the demonstration Choice The best choice would be Rkt for it s ease of use (which is good for contribution) and wide range of isolation features + access to the big docker ecosystem without beeing a burden for the host administrator. Note : the limitation of NsJail I saw might be due to my lack of knowledge regarding system administration. Proposed use of rkt regarding connectors Installation As stated before, rkt is easy to install. It may also be possible to make it available in the cozy-stack docker image but I did not test it (TODO) Image creation To create an ACI file image, you just need to run a docker image one time : rkt run --uuid-file-save=$PWD/uuid --insecure-options=image --interactive docker://node:slim --name nodeslim -- -v rkt export --app=nodeslim `cat uuid` nodeslim.aci amp; amp; rm uuid The node:slim image weights 84M at this time. The node:alpine image also exists and is way lighter (19M) but I had problems with DNS with this, and alpine can cause some nasty bugs that are difficult to track. Running a connector A path dedicated to run the konnectors with a predefined list of node packages available (the net module could be mocked with special limitations to blacklist some urls) A script will run the node container giving as option the script to launch. The path is mounted inside the container. The following script does just that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 #!/usr/bin/env bash rm -rf ./container_dir cp -r ./container_dir_template ./container_dir rkt run --net = host --environment = CREDENTIAL = value ; COZY_URL = url --uuid-file-save = $PWD /uuid --volume data,kind = host,source = $PWD /container_dir --insecure-options = image nodeslim.aci --cpu = 100m --memory = 128M --name rktnode --mount volume = data,target = /usr/src/app --exec node -- /usr/src/app/ $1 $2 amp ; # the container will handle itself the communication with the stack sleep 60 rkt stop --force --uuid-file = uuid rkt rm --uuid-file = uuid rm -rf ./container_dir This script can be run like this : ./rkt.sh mynewkonnector.js If the mynewkonnector.js file is available in the container_dir_template directory. Cons : must forbid access to port 5984 and 6060 + SMTP server The limitation of time, CPU and memory will avoid most DOS attacks (to my knowledge). For memory use, I still don t see a way to prevent the excessive use of swap from the container. To prevent the connectors from listening to each other, they should be run in containers with different uid, avoiding them to listen to each other. Solution to limit access of the container to 5984 and 6060 ports + SMTP The container must be started in bridged mode. With that, the container still has access to localhost but through a specific IP address visible with ifconfig. That way, the host can have iptable rules to forbid access to specified ports to the bridge. To connect a container in bridge mode : On the host create the file /etc/rkt/net.d/10-containers.conf { name : bridge , type : bridge , bridge : rkt-bridge-nat , ipMasq : true, isGateway : true, ipam : { type : host-local , subnet : 10.2.0.0/24 , routes : [ { dst : 0.0.0.0/0 } ] } } and run your container with the net=bridge option. That way, a new interface is available in the container and gives you access to the host. Konnector install and run details Install The konnectors will be installed in the .cozy_konnectors directory which is in the VFS using git clone (like the apps at the moment). The konnectors installation may be triggered when the user says he wants to use it. The resulting repository is then kept for each run of the konnector. It may then be given to the user the possibility to upgrade the konnector to the latest version if any. To update a given konnector, a git pull command is run on the konnector. Details about running a konnector To run a given konnector, the stack will copy this connector in a run directory, which is not in the VFS. This directory will be given to the rocket container as the current working directory with full read and write access on it. This is where the container will put its logs and any temp file needed. There will be also cozy-client.js and the shared libraries in a lib directory inside this directory. The lib directory will be the content of the actual server lib directory . The konnector will be run with the following environment variables : COZY_CREDENTIALS : containing the response to Oauth request as json string COZY_URL : to know what instance is running the konnector COZY_FIELDS : as a json string with all the values from the account associated to the konnector. COZY_PARAMETERS : optional json string associated with the application, used to parameterize a konnector based on a common set of code. In the end of the konnector execution (or timeout), the logs are read in the log.txt file and added to the konnector own log file (in VFS) and the run directory is then destroyed. Multi-account handling This section is devoted to allow the user to use one account for multiple konnectors. It will follow the following constraints in mind: The migration path must be as easy as possible The developpement and maintainance of konnector must also be as easy as possible New doctype : io.cozy.accounts A new doctype will have to be created to allow to keep konnector accounts independently from each konnector. The one once used by the email application seems to be a good candidate : io.cozy.accounts Here is an example document with this doctype : { _id: ojpiojpoij , name: user decided name for the account , accountType: google , login: mylogin , password: 123456 } Any attribute needed for the account may be added : email, etc Updates needed in existing application and konnectors CRUD manipulation of io.cozy.accounts and linking them with konnectors will be handled by the my accounts client application. Each konnector need also to declare a new field in the fields attribute which will be the type of account, related to the accountType field in the new account docType. Ex: module . exports = baseKonnector . createNew ({ name: Trainline , vendorLink: www.captaintrain.com , category: transport , color: { hex: #48D5B5 , css: #48D5B5 }, fields: { login: { type: text }, password: { type: password }, folderPath: { type: folder , advanced: true }, accountType: trainline }, dataType: [ bill ], models: [ Bill ], fetchOperations: [ ... ] }) With this new field, which will appear also in the io.cozy.konnectors docType, the my account client appliction will be able to propose existing accounts of the good type for activating a new konnector. Migration path For the migration of existing, activated konnectors in V2, the type of account for each konnector will have to be indicated in a V2 my account application update. After that, it will be possible to create the accounts associated to each activated konnectors an link the konnectors to these accounts in a migration script. Study on konnectors installation on VFS The VFS is slow and installing npm packages on it will cause some performance problem. We are trying to find solution to handle that. We found 3 possible solutions : Install the konnector on VFS as tar.gz files with all the dependencies included by the konnector developper advantages : easy for the konnector developper, as performant as a cp, no nedd for a compiled version of the konnector source, no duplication of code in the repo drawbacks : The source are not readable in files application then more complicated to study the konnector source, not really nice , still could take a lot of space on VFS Use webpack with target: node option to make a node bundle of the dependencies advantages : the konnector itself stays in clear on the VFS drawbacks : forces a compilation of the sources and then a sync between the source and bundle in the git repo by the konnector developper, forces konnector developpers to use webpack. Install the npm dependencies with yarn in an immutable cache ( cache-folder option) in a directory like deps-${konnector-git-sha1} not in VFS. advantages : easier for the konnector developper, no particular dependency handling, no mandatory compilation, just a package.json in the git repository, the cache can be shared by instances drawbacks : node only solution, maybe more work on the cozy-stack side TODO [x] How to install and update the konnectors?

Files synchronization Replication of too heavy database (with a lot of attachments) has been, in cozy experience, the source of some bugs.

Quick summary The replicator figures out what was the last sequence number lastseqno which was correctly synced from the source database, using a _local/:replicationid document. The replicator GET :source/changes?since=lastseqno limit=batchsize and identify which docs have changed (and their open_revs ).

The replicator GET :source/:docid?open_revs=['rev1', ...] several times to retrieve the missing documents revisions. The replicator POST :target/_bulk_docs with these documents revisions. Store the new last sequence number Repeat 2-5 until there is no more changes. Details In step 5, the replicator can also attempt to PUT :target/:docid if doc are too heavy, but this should not happens in cozy-stack considering there wont be attachment in couchdb. In step 4, the replicator can optimize by calling GET The main difference from couchdb 1.X is in the replication history and the manner to determine and store the last sequence number. TODO: actually understand this and how it might increase disk usage if we have a lot of replications. Couchdb _changes and by extension replication can be either by polling or continuous (SSE / COMET) In couchdb benchmarking, we understood that the number of couch databases only use a bit of disk space but no RAM or CPU as long as the database is not used . Having a continuous replication active force us to keep the database file open and will starve RAM FD usage. Moreover, continuous replication costs a lot (cf. ScienceTeam benchmark). To permit an unlimited number of inactive user on a single cozy-stack process, the stack should avoid continuous replication from couchdb . Two way replication is simply two one way replications Routes used by replication To be a source of replication, the stack only need to support the following route (and query parameters): GET :source/:docid get revisions of a document. The query parameters open_revs, revs, latest is necessary for replication. POST :source/_all_docs is used by current version of cozy-mobile and pouchdb as an optimization to fetch several document s revision at once. GET :source/_changes get a list of ID - New Revision since a given sequence number. The query parameters since, limit are necessary for replication. To be a target of replication, the stack need to support the following routes: POST :target/_revs_diff takes a list of ID - Rev and returns which one are missing. POST :target/_bulk_docs create several documents at once POST :target/_ensure_full_commit ensure the documents are written to disk. This is useless if couchdb is configured without delayed write (default), but remote couchdb will call, so the stack should return the expected 201 In both case, we need to support PUT :both/_local/:revdocid to store the current sequence number. Stack Sync API exploration Easy part: 1 db/doctype on stack AND remote, no binaries We just need to implement the routes described above by proxying to the underlying couchdb database. var db = new PouchDB ( my-local-contacts ); db . replicate . from ( https://bob.cozycloud.cc/data/contacts ); db . replicate . to ( https://bob.cozycloud.cc/data/contacts ); To suport this we need to: Proxy /data/:doctype/_changes route with since, limit, feed=normal. Refuse all filter parameters with a clear error message. (Doc) Add support of open_revs , revs , latest query parameter to GET /data/:doctype/:docid (Doc) Proxy the /data/:doctype/_revs_diff (Doc) and /data/:doctype/_bulk_docs routes (Doc) routes Have /data/:doctype/_ensure_full_commit (Doc) returns 201 This will cover documents part of the Devices use case. Continuous replication It is impossible to implement it by simply proxying to couchdb (see unlimited inactive users). The current version of cozy-desktop uses it. TODISCUSS It could be replaced by 3-minutes polling without big losses in functionality, eventually with some more triggers based on user activity. The big use case for which we might want it is Sharing. But, because Sharing will (first) be stack to stack, we might imagine having the source of event ping the remote through a separate route. Conclusion: Start with polling replication. Consider alternative notifications mechanism when the usecase appears and eventually use time-limited continuous replication for a few special case (collaborative edit). Realtime One of the cool feature of cozy apps was how changes are sent to the client in realtime through websocket. However this have a cost: every cozy and every apps open in a browser, even while not used keep one socket open on the server, this is not scalable to thousands of users. Several technology can be used for realtime: Websocket, SSE or COMET like long-polling. Goroutines makes all solution similar performances wise. COMET is a hack, websocket seems more popular and tested (x/net/websocket vs html5-sse-example). SSE is not widely available and has some limitations (headers ) Depending on benchmarking, we can do some optimization on the feed: close feeds when the user is not on screen multiplex different applications feed, so each open cozy will only use one socket to the server. This is hard, as all apps live on separate domain, an (hackish) option might be a iframe/SharedWorker bridge. To have some form of couchdb-to-stack continuous changes monitoring, we can monitor _db_udpates (Doc) which gives us an update when a couchdb has changed. We can then perform a _changes query on this database to get the changed docs and proxy that to the stack-to-client change feed. Conclusion: We will use Websocket from the client to the stack. We will try to avoid using continuous changes feed from couchdb to the stack. We will optimize if proven needed by benchmarks, starting with useless changes and eventually some multiplexing. Sharing To be completed by discussing with Science team. Current ideas (as understood by Romain) any filtered replication is unscalable 1 db for all shared docs sharing_db . Cozy-stack is responsible for saving documents that should be shared in both their dg implemented by 2-way replication between the 2 users sharing_db , filtering is done by computing a list of IDs and then doc_ids (sharing with filters/views are not efficient) Sharing is performed by batches regularly. Continuous replication can be considered for collaborative editing. Proposal by Romain, if we find _selector filter replication performances to be acceptable on very large / very old databases. No sharing database A permission, for anything is a mango-style selector. on every query, the Mango selector is checked at the stack or couchdb level ( $and -ing for queries, testing output document, input document) Sharing is a filtered replication between user s 1 doctypedb et user s 2 samedoctypedb No continuous replication Upon update, the stack trigger a PUSH replication to its remote or ping the remote, and the remote perform a normal PULL replication.

Consider alternative notifications mechanism when the usecase appears and eventually use time-limited continuous replication for a few special case (collaborative edit).","title":"Continuous replication"},{"location":"cozy-stack/archives/replication/#realtime","text":"One of the cool feature of cozy apps was how changes are sent to the client in realtime through websocket. However this have a cost: every cozy and every apps open in a browser, even while not used keep one socket open on the server, this is not scalable to thousands of users. Several technology can be used for realtime: Websocket, SSE or COMET like long-polling. Goroutines makes all solution similar performances wise. COMET is a hack, websocket seems more popular and tested (x/net/websocket vs html5-sse-example). SSE is not widely available and has some limitations (headers ) Depending on benchmarking, we can do some optimization on the feed: close feeds when the user is not on screen multiplex different applications feed, so each open cozy will only use one socket to the server. This is hard, as all apps live on separate domain, an (hackish) option might be a iframe/SharedWorker bridge. To have some form of couchdb-to-stack continuous changes monitoring, we can monitor _db_udpates (Doc) which gives us an update when a couchdb has changed. We can then perform a _changes query on this database to get the changed docs and proxy that to the stack-to-client change feed. Conclusion: We will use Websocket from the client to the stack. We will try to avoid using continuous changes feed from couchdb to the stack. We will optimize if proven needed by benchmarks, starting with useless changes and eventually some multiplexing.","title":"Realtime"},{"location":"cozy-stack/archives/replication/#sharing","text":"To be completed by discussing with Science team.

Therefore we will use the classical stack: a JavaScript web application and cordova At the end of this documentation , you will find how-tos to help you with cordova configuration , webpack builds and cordova deployments for Android and iOS . To create your first Cozy application , just follow the guide. As you can read there, Cozy applications are served by the Cozy server, this is the way that Cozy applications retrieve a token to query data. In the case of a mobile application, you need to retrieve a token differently. Hopefully we provide everything you need to do it easily. You ll need two libraries: cozy-client ( source ) cozy-bar ( source ) In the case of Cozy web applications served by the Cozy server, these two libraries are injected in the html file with variables {{.CozyClientJS}} and {{.CozyBar}} . Setup index.html First thing first, add JavaScript libraries files into your index.html : !DOCTYPE html html lang = en head meta charset = utf-8 title mobile Cozy application with Cordova / title script src = cozy-client.js / script script src = cozy-bar.js / script / head body !-- page content -- / body / html Connect to Cozy server When an user will start your mobile Cozy application, she/he will need to point to her/his server url to ask for permissions for her/his device. This is done by our library cozy-client , you just need to add a HTML form: form id = form label What is your cozy server url? input name = url id = url type = text / / label button type = submit Submit / button / form const urlInput = document . getElementById ( url ); const form = document . getElementById ( form ); form . addEventListener ( submit , registerClient ); function registerClient ( event ) { event . preventDefault (); const url = urlInput . value ; const { client , token } = await cozyClient . register ( url ); // do whatever you need with client and token like persist } JS Bin on jsbin.com When cozyClient.register(url) is called, the cordova inapp browser plugin is used to display a password request and a permission acceptation page to let the end-user to register her/his device. That s all! Then you can use the cozy-client library as you would within a classic Cozy application . Initialize the Cozy bar The Cozy bar needs some information to be initialized and its initialization must be done in your front-end code: cozy . bar . init ({ appName : App Name , appEditor : Editor Name , iconPath : require ( ./assets/app-icon.svg ), lang : en-US , replaceTitleOnMobile : true }) Use Cordova Install and setup cordova Cordova is a tool to build Android and iOS applications from a web app. It works with a CLI that needs node . Look at the cordova documentation to install everything needed . Once cordova is installed, just run cordova create cozy-app com.example.cozyapp CozyApp and you get the following structure: ./ \u251c\u2500\u2500 config.xml \u251c\u2500\u2500 hooks \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 platforms \u251c\u2500\u2500 plugins \u2514\u2500\u2500 www \u251c\u2500\u2500 css \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.css \u251c\u2500\u2500 img \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 logo.png \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.html \u2514\u2500\u2500 js \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.js 7 directories, 6 files Note: everything you put in www/ will be served as your application content. Configure your build tool If you use a build tool to transpile your JavaScript code, you need to configure your tool to output the build into www/ . webpack configuration As Webpack is the most used build tool we will show you how to configure it with cordova: Create a webpack.config.js on the root folder of your project with: const path = require ( path ); module . exports = { entry : ./src/app.js , output : { filename : bundle.js , path . resolve ( __dirname , www ) } } And add the output bundle in the www/index.html file: html head ... / head body ... script src = bundle.js / script / body / html See the official webpack documentation for more details. Cordova Android Platform Use cordova platform add android and check your environment with cordova requirements : A bad requirements check: Requirements check results for android: Java JDK: installed .

Applications may require server-side code execution that could not, or should not, be in the client. This might be useful for heavy computations or for tasks triggered after some events, typically after data is retrieved through konnectors or mobile/desktop sync, without the user being on the application. In contrast to konnectors, services have the same permissions as the web application and are not intended to collect information from the outside. It is rather meant to asynchronously analyse data inside the cozy and emit some output once the task is done. However, they share the same mechanisms as the konnectors to describe how and when they should be executed: via our trigger system . Example You can find an example of an existing service in the cozy-banks app . Service declaration The service must be declared in the app manifest . For example: services : { onOperationCreate : { type : node , file : onOperationCreate.js , trigger : @event io.cozy.bank.operations:CREATED , debounce : 3m } } Here is an explanation of the fields: type : describe the code type (only node for now). file : the single (packaged) file containing the code to execute as a service. trigger : what triggers the service. It must follow the available triggers described in the jobs documentation . In this example, the trigger is a bank operation creation. debounce (optionnal): force a minimal delay between two runs of the service. m is for minutes and s for seconds. if this parameter is omitted, the service will be executed as soon as it can. Build The service must be packaged into a single file containing all the dependencies. An example of a webpack rule is available here . Note that target: 'node' is important as the service is run as a Node.js process. In this example, the services are built alongside your app using yarn watch . Stack As the service is run on a dedicated process on the server side, a running stack is necessary. You can either use a stack installed with docker or directly from source . Some configuration is required to execute the service and store the produced logs, to facilitate the development. The following instructions are for a stack installed from source, but you can easily adapt it for a docker installation: you just have to download the default config file , modify it as described below and indicate its location through the docker command, as explained here . In the following, we assume that your $HOME is /home/alice, so change accordingly to your own $HOME . Copy the default config file Create a directory ~/.cozy and copy the default configuration file into it. Be careful, the file name and location matter, as explained in the config documentation . cp cozy-stack/cozy.example.yaml ~/.cozy/cozy.yaml ` Edit the config file Edit the file ~/.cozy/cozy.yaml and change the line after the konnectors: entry to have this: cmd : /home/alice/.cozy/scripts/konnector-node-run.sh Then, after the entry fs : url : file:///home/alice/.cozy/storage Create the script to store the logs Create the file ~/.cozy/scripts/konnector-node-run.sh : #!/bin/bash rundir = ${ 1 } cd $rundir node index.js | tee ~/.cozy/services.log Install your app To install the app containing the service on your local stack, you must give the path of your build: cozy-stack apps install app_name file:// build_path Each time you make modifications to your service, you must update the app on the stack to propagate the changes: cozy-stack apps update app_name Execution The service will be run each time the trigger condition is met, e.g. a bank operation.

Following the previous example: git tag 1 .4.0-beta.1 git push origin 1 .4.0-beta.1 NB: Version number in package.json and manifest.webapp is still 1.4.0 If this beta version is ok, it can be tagged as stable git tag 1 .4.0 git push origin 1 .4.0 But if the beta is not ok, fixes are committed into the release branch and a new beta version is tagged. git tag 1 .4.0-beta.2 git push origin 1 .4.0-beta.2 This process is repeated until a beta version is validated and ready to be tagged as stable. During the release, development continues in master without impacting release-1.4.0 .

The server (Cozy-stack - documentation ) The server consist of a single process. We call it the Cozy stack . The server is in charge of serving the Web applications users have installed from the application store. It provides its services through a REST API that allows to: create, update, delete documents inside the database; authenticate users and client applications; send emails; launch jobs on the server. Connectors that import data from remote websites are some sort of jobs. Jobs can be one time tasks (sending a message) or periodic tasks. Some jobs, like the connectors, that require executing third party code on the server side, are sandboxed (we use nsjail for now). \u2026 The server also allow to access the database replication API, allowing to sync documents between the server and local databases, for example in mobile clients. Two authentication methods are available: Web applications running on the server get a session token when the user log in; OAuth2 for other applications. The database CouchDB is a document database. Everything, from user data to server settings, is stored inside typed documents, identified by an unique id. Two request methods are allowed: map-reduce or Mango , a specific query language.

All you need to have is: NodeJS 10+ Yarn : a NodeJS package manager, like npm Docker to have a Cozy for dev Some basics about developing a single page application in HTML/JS or you just want to learn :) Install the development environment The only tool required to have a Cozy for development is Docker. Install Docker for OSX Install Docker for Windows (We have been told that installing Docker on some familial flavours of Windows may be a bit difficult. It has not been tested yet for this documentation.) Install Docker for GNU/linux: Ubuntu / Fedora / Debian / CentOs On GNU/Linux, according to the documentation : \u00ab The docker daemon binds to a Unix socket instead of a TCP port. By default that Unix socket is owned by the user root and other users can only access it using sudo. If you don\u2019t want to use sudo when you use the docker command, create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. Be warned that the docker group grants privileges equivalent to the root user. You should have a look at Docker\u2019s documentation on security . Every application running inside Cozy is a client-side HTML5 application interacting with your data through the API of the server. To develop an application, you\u2019ll require a running Cozy server. The easiest way is to use the Docker image for developers we provide. Just install it: docker pull cozy/cozy-app-dev Note We update this image on a regular basis with the latest version of the server and our library. Don\u2019t forget to update the image by running docker pull cozy/cozy-app-dev from time to time to keep your Cozy dev up to date. Create your application You can boostrap your application from scratch if you want, but we highly recommand to use our dedicated community tool create-cozy-app to bootstrap very easily a Cozy application for you. This tool will generate an application using React, the framework we internally use in the Cozy Front team. But options are available if you want to use other frameworks. To do so, run directly create-cozy-app without installing it globally by using the yarn create cozy-app command to bootstrap your application: yarn create cozy-app mycozyapp The script will download some dependencies (may take a while) and ask you a few questions, then create an application skeleton inside mycozyapp . Here is a quick demo of what s happening: That s it! You can already start developing: cd mycozyapp yarn start This command will run webpack in a watching mode with a server (webpack-dev-server) to serve application assets. a Cozy stack using docker (the image cozy/cozy-app-dev ) to serve your application inside it. The same docker image starts a CouchDB containing your data (be careful, since a data volume is not attached by default, your data will disappear on restart. You should start the docker image manually if you want to persist your data). Your application will be available at http:// .cozy.tools:8080. Password is cozy . In this mode HMR (Hot Module Replacement) is available to help you with the application development. Going Further What is cozy.tools ? You may see in our documentation that we use *.cozy.tools as domain for the local Cozy. Since Cozy uses subdomains to serve the applications, we can t use directly localhost as it. We have just parameterized this *.cozy.tools domain to always redirect to 127.0.0.1 , your local computer address. With that, no need to configure your environment to set extra local hosts for development anymore. How the application works? The minimal application consist of only two files: an HTML file, index.html , with the markup and the code of your application a manifest describing the application. It\u2019s a JSON file named manifest.webapp with the name of the application, the permissions it requires\u2026 We\u2019ll have a deeper look to it content later. Your application requires some informations to interact with the server API, for example the URL of its entrypoint, and an auth token. This data will be dynamically injected into index.html when it serves the page. So the index.html file has to contain some string that will be replaced by the server. The general syntax of this variables is {{\u2026}} , so don\u2019t use this syntax for other purpose in the page, for example inside comments. You can use the following variables: {{.Domain}} will be substituted by the URL of the API entrypoint {{.Token}} will be replaced by a token that authenticate your application when accessing the API {{.Locale}} : the lang f the instance {{.AppName}} : the name of the application {{.AppNamePrefix}} : the name prefix of the application {{.AppSlug}} : the slug of the application {{.AppEditor}} : the editor of the application {{.IconPath}} will be replaced by HTML code to display the favicon {{.CozyClientJS}} will be replaced with HTML code to inject the Cozy client library (old Cozy client) {{.CozyBar}} will be replaced with HTML code to inject the upper menu bar {{.ThemeCSS}} will be replaced by the theme.css . It is empty by default, but can be overrided by using contexts . {{.Favicon}} will be replaced by the favicon served by the stack. This allows to get this kind of index.html : !DOCTYPE html html lang = {{.Locale}} head meta charset = utf-8 title My Awesome App for Cozy / title meta name = viewport content = width=device-width, initial-scale=1 link rel = stylesheet src = my-app.css {{.ThemeCSS}} {{.CozyClientJS}} {{.CozyBar}} / head body div role = application data-cozy-token = {{.Token}} data-cozy-stack = {{.Domain}} / div script src = my-app.js / script / body / html Read the application manifest Each application must have a \u201cmanifest\u201d. It\u2019s a JSON file named manifest.webapp stored at the root of theapplication directory. It describes the application, the type of documents it uses, the permissions it requires\u2026 Here\u2019s a sample manifest: { name : My Awesome application , name_prefix : , slug : myapp , permissions : { apps : { type : io.cozy.apps }, permissions : { type : io.cozy.permissions }, settings : { type : io.cozy.settings }, sample : { type : io.cozy.dev.sample , verbs : [ GET , POST , PUT , PATCH , DELETE ] }, jobs : { type : io.cozy.jobs } }, routes : { / : { folder : / , index : index.html , public : false }, /public : { folder : /public , index : index.html , public : true } } } Permissions Applications require permissions to use most of the APIs. Permissions can be described inside the manifest, so theserver can ask the user to grant them during installation. Applications can also request permissions at run time. A permission must at type contain a target, the type of objects the application want to interact with. Can be a document type, or an action on the server. By default, all grant on this object are granted, but we can also request fine grained permissions, for example limiting to read access. We can also limit the scope to a subset of thedocuments. In the manifest, each permission is an object, with a random name and some properties: - type : mandatory the document type or action name - description : a text that will be displayed to the user to explain why the application require this permission - verbs : an array of HTTP verbs. For example, to limit permissions to read access, use [\"GET\"] - selector : a document attribute to limit access to a subset of documents - values : array of allowed values for this attribute. An application can request a token that grant access to a subset of its own permissions. For example if the application has full access to the files, it can obtain a token that give only read access on a file. Thus, the application can make some documents publicly available. The public page of the application will use this token asauthentication token when accessing the API. Samples Application require full access to files: { permissions : { files : { description : \u2026 , type : io.cozy.files }, } } Application want to be able to read the contact informations of cozy@cozycloud.cc { permissions : { contact : { type : io.cozy.contacts , verbs : [ GET ], selector : email , values : [ cozy@cozycloud.cc ] } } } Routing The application must declare all of its URLs (routes) inside the manifest. A route is an object associating an URL toan HTML file. Each route has the following properties: folder : the base folder of the route index : the name of the file inside this folder public : a boolean specifying whether the route is public or private (default). Sample: routes : { /admin : { folder : / , index : admin.html , public : false }, /public : { folder : /public , index : index.html , public : true }, /assets : { folder : /assets , public : true } } Behind the magic Some server APIs may not be available right now through the library. If you want to use one of this method, you\u2019llhave to call it manually. We\u2019ll describe here how to access the API without using the Cozy Client library. Connecting to the API requires three things: its URL, injected into the page through the {{.Domain}} variable the application auth token, injected into the page through the {{.Token}} variable. Each request sent to theserver must include this token in the Authorization header the session cookie, created when you connect to your server. This is an HttpOnly cookie , meaning that JavaScriptapplications can\u2019t read it. This prevent a malicious script to stole the cookie. Here\u2019s a sample code that get API informations provided by the server and query the API: div data-cozy-token = {{.Token}} data-cozy-domain = {{.Domain}} / document . addEventListener ( DOMContentLoaded , () = { use strict ; const app = document . querySelector ( [data-cozy-token] ); fetch ( `// ${ app . dataset . cozyDomain } /apps` , { method : GET , headers : { Authorization : `Bearer ${ app . dataset . cozyToken } ` // Here we use the auth token }, credentials : include // don\u2019t forget to include the session cookie }) . then ( function ( response ) { if ( response . ok ) { response . json (). then (( result ) = { console . log ( result ); }); } else { throw new Error ( Network response was not ok. ); } }) . catch ( function ( error ) { console . log ( There has been a problem with your fetch operation: + error . message ); }); }); Handle data with cozy-client cozy-client is a simple and declarative way of managing cozy-stack API callsand resulting data. It is a convenient yet powerful way to bind cozy-stack queries to your components. Getting started How to API docs Discover the Cozy Bar The Cozy Bar is a component that display the Cozy menu on the top of yourapplication and allow inter-apps features like content sharing. Your application interacts with this component through cozy-bar.js , a library injected into your pages by theserver when you add {{.CozyBar}} in the header. It exposes an API behind the window.cozy.bar namespace. Before using it, you have to initialize the library: window.cozy.bar.init({appName: \"Mon application\"}) . Style with Cozy UI If you plan to build a webapp to run on Cozy, you\u2019ll probably want to use a simple and elegant solution to build your interfaces without the mess of dealing with complex markup and CSS. Then Cozy UI is here for you! It relies on Stylus as preprocessor. You can add it as a library in your project to use it out-of-the-box.","title":"Create Your Application"},{"location":"tutorials/app/#prerequisites","text":"Developing an application for Cozy is quite easy.

To protect your data, each connector runs inside a container in order to sandbox all their interactions with your data. \u26a0\ufe0f For historical reasons, in the Cozy codebase, a cozy connector is named konnector, please follow this convention if modifying an existing application. How does it work? A connector is a NodeJS script. The target node version used to run your connector is the version 8. Like client side apps, connectors communicate with the Cozy Stack using its HTTP API, and get a unique auth token every time they start. They need to register with a manifest, and ask the user for permissions. To facilitate connector development, a npm package, cozy-konnector-libs , provides some shared libraries that are adapted to be used for a connector: cheerio to easily query a HTML page request-promise : request with Promise support request-debug that displays all the requests and responses in the standard output. Toggle debug option in requestFactory options Besides, you ll probably need some other npm packages to help you run your connector: momentjs or date-fns to manage dates bluebird to get enhanced promises When the connector is started, it also receives some data via environment variables: COZY_CREDENTIALS : an auth token used by cozy-client-js to communicate with the server COZY_URL : the Cozy Stack API entry point COZY_FIELDS : settings coming from [Cozy Collect] and filled by the user (login, password, directory path). These variables are used by the connector and the cozy-client to configure the connection to the Cozy Stack with the right permissions as defined in the connector manifest. They are simulated in standalone mode so that you do not need a real Cozy Stack to develop a connector. [ More about BaseKonnector ] From the server point of view, each connector is a job which is executed periodically via a trigger . [ More about Cozy Stack jobs ] Let\u2019s create our first connector The easiest way to create a new connector is to use cozy-konnector-template : \u2139 There is also a (french) youtube video to create your first connector Run the sample First of all, download or clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/konnectors/cozy-konnector-template cozy-konnector-newservice cd cozy-konnector-newservice rm -rf .git git init yarn install # or npm install note: we use yarn , but if you prefer npm , keep using it, everything should work. The connector is ready to run with sample code. As a demo we will scrape a fictional website: books.toscrape.com , for which you do not need credentials . As indicated in the README.md file, just run: yarn standalone # or npm run standalone The very first run will create a konnector-dev-config.json file that allows you to configure the connector input when executing it with the CLI. This configuration comes from [Cozy Collect] when deployed. { COZY_URL : http://cozy.tools:8080 , fields : { // configuration injected to the start function } } The fields property allows you to set credentials for the targeted web service, such as login and password as if they come from Cozy Stack (so from a real Cozy Cloud instance). You can add as many fields as the targeted service needs. The COZY_URL property will be used later. You do not need to change it for now. As explained earlier, the demo website books.toscrape.com does not need any credentials. But for the code to run without error, you need to register a fake login and a fake password: { COZY_URL : http://cozy.tools:8080 , fields : { login : zuck.m@rk.fb , password : 123456 } } In the template, this configuration file is already added to .gitignore file to be sure your credentials stay private. Now you can run the connector again in standalone mode to see how jpg and related data are downloaded. In this mode, [ cozy-client-js ] is stubbed and all data meant to be saved in a cozy are displayed in the standard output and files are saved in the ./data directory of the connector. This is useful to start developing your connector without handling the state of a real Cozy Stack . Please check CLI section of the documentation for more information. Implement your connector There are four steps for a connector to save data to Cozy Stack : authentication request data parse and format data save data to cozy stack You can see these steps in the src/index.js in the konnectors/template : async function start ( fields ) { // step 1. log ( info , Authenticating ... ) await authenticate ( fields . login , fields . password ) log ( info , Successfully logged in ) // step 2. // The BaseKonnector instance expects a Promise as return of the function log ( info , Fetching the list of documents ) const $ = await request ( ` ${ baseUrl } /index.html` ) // step 3. log ( info , Parsing list of documents ) const documents = await parseDocuments ( $ ) // step 4. // here we use the saveBills function even if what we fetch are not bills, but this is the most // common case in connectors log ( info , Saving data to Cozy ) await saveBills ( documents , fields . folderPath , { // this is a bank identifier which will be used to link bills to bank operations. These // identifiers should be at least a word found in the title of a bank operation related to this // bill. It is not case sensitive. identifiers : [ books ] }) } Authentication Open the src/index.js file, there are comments to guide you through it. The very first step is to be able to authenticate to the remote service, this is done with the line: note: don t forget to add your additional fields if you have some. await authenticate ( fields . login , fields . password ) There are many obstacles at this level: is there a captcha? is there a 2FA? how is the form ? note: if the remote service exposes an API, you should use classical request call. Let s say the remote service exposes a simple classical form like https://www.trainline.eu/signin: form id = signin-form novalidate = class = signin__form data-ember-action = data-ember-action-680 = 680 input name = email autocomplete = on placeholder = Email Address id = ember691 class = ember-text-field textfield ember-view data-enpass . usermodified = yes type = email input name = password autocomplete = on placeholder = Password id = ember696 class = ember-text-field textfield ember-view data-enpass . usermodified = yes type = password div class = signin__forgot span data-ember-action = data-ember-action-697 = 697 a href = /password id = ember698 class = ember-view Forgot your password? / a / span / div div class = signin__buttons div class = signin__buttons-block button type = submit class = signin__button Sign In / button / div / div / form Find a CSS selector for the form tag: form#signin-form . Find the name of the input tags used to host user s credentials: email and password . You are ready to complete the signin(options) object called in the authenticate(username, password) function: function authenticate ( username , password ) { return signin ({ url : `https://www.trainline.eu/signin` , formSelector : form#signin-form , formData : { email : username , password }, // email and password correspond to the name attribut of the HTML inputs validate : ( statusCode , $ ) = { // write some code to validate the form submission } }) } To implement the validate function, you need to check what is happening on a successful login and on an unsuccessful login. With the https://www.trainline.eu/signin example, fill the form with wrong credentials, open your browser s devtools (and check the network tab) and submit the form. Here it is clear, on incorrect credentials, the response have a status code 422 : HTTP/2.0 422 No Reason Phrase Do the same with valid credentials. HTTP/2.0 200 OK Then you can write a simple and straight forward validate code: function authenticate ( username , password ) { return signin ({ url : `https://www.trainline.eu/signin` , formSelector : form#signin-form , formData : { email : username , password }, validate : ( statusCode , $ ) = { return statusCode === 200 || log ( error , Invalid credentials ) } }) } However if the target website doesn t use statusCode correctly you can also use fullResponse.request.uri.href to check if there is a redirection to a page that requires to be logged in : validate : ( statusCode , $ , fullResponse ) = { return fullResponse . request . uri . href == https://example.com/account || log ( error , Invalid credentials ) } It is also possible to use Cheerio to check if an HTML element is present in the web page or not : validate : ( statusCode , $ ) = { return $ ( a[href= https://example.com/logout ] ). length == 1 || log ( error , $ ( .error ). text ()) } Request data Once the connector is able to be authenticated by the online service, the next step is to fetch data. The most common case is that the invoices we want to fetch are listed in a HTML page. So to request data, we fetch the target webpage that contains invoices list. But sometimes, the webpage is a JavaScript page that uses a JSON API URL. JSON is easier to parse than full HTML webpages. For the purpose of this guide, let s consider we are in the case of a full HTML webpage, like the service given as an example in the template: http://books.toscrape.com This is the easiest part, just fetch the webpage: const $ = await request ( http://books.toscrape.com/index.html ) The $ variable is set to a cheerio object with useful API to crawl the webpage . \u2139 You can name this variable as you want and create as many as you want Cheerio variables such as : $doc or $page . That object will be very useful for the next step. Parse the document We want to get every article / of the page in a JavaScript Array: const articles = []. map . call ( $ ( article , node = node )) For every book, we want to catch the title attribute of this tag article h3 a . This is a CSS Selector that cheerio understands to select some part of the tree. In order to crawl a list of items to create an Array of JSON object, we can create our own function or use the function scrape from the connector libs : const docs = scrape ( $ , { title : { sel : h3 a , attr : title }, amount : { sel : .price_color , parse : normalizePrice }, url : { sel : h3 a , attr : href , parse : url = ` ${ baseUrl } / ${ url } ` }, fileurl : { sel : img , attr : src , parse : src = ` ${ baseUrl } / ${ src } ` }, filename : { sel : h3 a , attr : title , parse : title = ` ${ title } .jpg` } }, article ) Keep in mind that there are many useful CSS Pseudo-classes and Combinators that you can use in your CSS selectors to help you select HTML elements. This code will loop on article / and for each item will create a JSON object with the selector sel and the value of attribute attr if specified, otherwise it takes the value of the child node, this value can be edited with the parse function. Here is a sample for the following markup from http://books.toscrape.com: article class = product_pod div class = image_container a href = catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html img src = media/cache/2c/da/2cdad67c44b002e7ead0cc35693c0e8b.jpg alt = A Light in the Attic class = thumbnail / a / div p class = star-rating Three i class = icon-star / i i class = icon-star / i i class = icon-star / i i class = icon-star / i i class = icon-star / i / p h3 a href = catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html title = A Light in the Attic A Light in the ... / a / h3 div class = product_price p class = price_color \u00a351.77 / p p class = instock availability i class = icon-ok / i In stock / p form button type = submit class = btn btn-primary btn-block data-loading-text = Adding... Add to basket / button / form / div / article And we will get the following JSON object: { title : A Light in the Attic , amount : 51.77 , url : http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html , fileurl : http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/2c/da/2cdad67c44b002e7ead0cc35693c0e8b.jpg , filename : A Light in the Attic.jpg } fileurl is used to tell Cozy where to find the file (here an image) to retreive. Then you can save it to Cozy Stack (see section below). There are many document types (Doctypes) you can store in your Cozy, such as : - Bills - Contacts - Bank - and so on\u2026 The code sample includes some other function to manipulate the result object, but we have the idea. Once we build a correct object, we can save it to Cozy Stack. Save data to Cozy Stack In the example we use some built-in function to save a bill to the Cozy Stack. But there is a bunch of functions available depending on what you want: addData hydrateAndFilter saveBills to save invoices files (this function use saveFiles ) that can be linked to your bank transactions. saveFiles to upload files to Cozy Drive. and so on\u2026 For example, to save bills to Cozy you have to start by recovering all required fields for a data type io.cozy.bills using the scrape function, and then you can use the function saveBills to save your docs to Cozy Stack as shown below: await saveBills ( documents , fields , { idenditifiers : [ vendor ], // name of the target website contentType : application/pdf }) documents is the list of bills returned by the function parseDocuments after the page scraping . We can find more information in the libs repository . Now that we pass on every steps, it is time to test the connector with yarn standalone . We will see next how to connect it effectively to a Cozy Stack. Going further Connector structure Basically, a connector is just a function passed to the BaseKonnector constructor, and which eventually returns a promise: To create the connector, just create a new instance of BaseKonnector with a function as argument: const { BaseKonnector } = require ( cozy-konnector-libs ) module . exports = new BaseKonnector ( fields = { // use fields to get user credentials and choices console . log ( fields , fields ) }) Typical workflow Everytime the connector is run, it will call the function and wait for the resolution of the returned promise. This function can then: log into the target website, fetch data, and save them as an array of objects with specific attributes expected by the save function ( saveFiles , addData , hydrateAndFilter , saveBills ). A basic connector workflow involves: authenticate on the website or API. Might be tricky, but that s the fun :-) getting data from the online service. You can get the data by calling an API or scraping the webpage. Check if the webpage itself is not using an API to retrieve data, might speed up our job. Mobile phones applications usually connects to an API that might be a reliable source of data. A quick exemple of a scraper here . filtering data to remove the ones already present inside the database using hydrateAndFilter save the filtered data into the database ( addData ) save the related files using ( saveFiles ) Error handling If your connector hits an issue fetching or saving the data, it can return an error code by throwing it as an error. The error codes are defined inside the [Cozy Collect] application and will display an explicit error to the user: LOGIN_FAILED : the connector could not login NOT_EXISTING_DIRECTORY : the folder specified as folder_to_save does not exist (checked automatically by the BaseKonnector) UNKNOWN_ERROR : there was an unexpected error, please take a look at the logs to know what happened VENDOR_DOWN : the target web site is down now USER_ACTION_NEEDED : The user needs to login to the service to do manual actions (could be Terms Of Service to validate) You can get the list of error codes in require('cozy-konnector-libs').errors ( source ) const { BaseKonnector , errors } = require ( cozy-konnector-libs ) module . exports = new BaseKonnector ( fields = { // Here, the following message will be displayed in cozy-collect : Bad credentials. Check the konnector fields and run the connection again. throw new Error ( errors . LOGIN_FAILED ) }) cozy-konnector-libs The Cozy Konnector Libs provide several useful methods for common tasks: BaseKonnector : creates the connector and fetches from the stack the connector s parameters (COZY_FIELDS ) cozyClient gives an instance of cozy-client-js already initialized according to COZY_URL , and COZY_CREDENTIALS . Your code can immediately interact with the server thanks to this client. requestFactory a function which returns an instance of request-promise initialized with defaults often used in connector development. log allows to log messages with different levels hydrateAndFilter to filter data addData to store the retrieved data into the cozy linkBankOperations to link a bill to a bank operation saveBills which uses hydrateAndFilter, addData, saveFiles and linkBankOperations and which is specific to bills updateOrCreate create or update documents inside database htmlToPDF to convert HTML code to PDF content to insert into a PDF file created with the createCozyPDFDocument function createCozyPDFDocument to create a new PDF file to pass to htmlToPDF Linking your connector to a cozy : dev mode After several yarn standalone , your connector is able to automaticaly gather data from the targeted web service. It s time now to put this data in a real cozy. Here comes the dev mode . For that your connector needs more setup : a manifest.konnector file a COZY_URL section in konnector-dev-config.json The manifest Each connector is described by a manifest. This is a JSON file named manifest.konnector at the root of your code folder. It should include the following minimal information: { name : konnector name , type : node , slug : konnectorslug , description : description , source : git://github.com/cozy/cozy-konnector-thename.git , permissions : { accounts : { description : Required to get the account s data , type : io.cozy.accounts , verbs : [ GET ] } } } cozy-konnector-template already has a manifest which you can customize. You may add some permissions for your own doctype. Here is the detailed list of fields for a connector manifest file. You can also get more information on permissions in the official cozy-stack documentation konnector-dev-config.json If you want to put data from your connector to a real cozy, your must define where to find this cozy, and this must be a cozy for which you have the credentials. Here comes the COZY_URL in konnector-dev-config.json which defines just that. Run the dev mode Then you just have to run: yarn dev For the first run, the CLI will open a tab in your browser asking you to grant permissions to the connector. The connector will then save data directly into your cozy. This will validate that your manifest has the needed permissions on the data you want to save. This is the dev mode. Integration in the store for all the users To run a connector, we do not want the cozy to install all dependencies of the connector each time it installs it. To avoid this, the connectors need to be compiled into one file in a dedicated branch of the repository and the repository needs to be a public git repository. The package.json file from cozy-konnector-template gives you the commands to do this : yarn build and yarn deploy but the last one needs to be configured in package.json Once your public git repository is configured, you only have to declare it. Cozy will soon have a store for connectors and you will be able to publish connectors yourself. But at the moment, you need to declare your new connector on the cozy forum . The Cozy team will review your code and add your connector to the [Cozy Collect] application. To make the connector available more quickly for all cozys, you can follow this few steps of packaging: Icon You need to push an icon in assets/ . Please respect this rules : Square icon, possibly a png or svg Try the Apple app store icon if needed Package.json Edit the name to be cozy-konnector- slug> Edit the repository URL Edit the command deploy with the correct repository URL Manifest.konnector Edit the name with a nice name (Capitals and spaces allowed here) Edit icon as needed Edit slug (no capitals and no spaces here) Edit source with the correct repository URL Add a correct vendor link Choose one or more categories (used to sort connectors in Cozy Store) in this list : banking, shopping, insurance, isp, telecom, energy, public_service, other . If needed, change the input type the target website use to login the user: text , email or phone for instance, this will enforce pre-checking Edit for both locales en and fr the short description and long description FAQ When I run my connector, a ghost node process eats all my memory Cozy-konnector-libs uses cheerio which is great but causes some problems when you try to console.log a cheerio object. In standalone or dev mode, the BaseKonnector tries to catch errors and display a maximum of details about them. But when the error contains a cheerio object, the problem happens. If you get this problem, catch the error yourself and only display the message : . catch ( err ) { console . log ( err . message ) // good console . log ( err ) // bad } How do I scrap a website Use the request function from cozy-konnector-libs with the proper options. Here\u2019s a sample code that will fetch the login page to get the value of the anti-CSRF token, submit the login form, browse to the bills page and fetch a bill: const { BaseKonnector , requestFactory } = require ( cozy-konnector-libs ) const rq = requestFactory ({ jar : true , // handle the cookies like a browser json : false , // do not try to parse the result as a json document cheerio : true // automatically parse the result with [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) }) const moment = require ( moment ) module . exports = new BaseKonnector ( function fetch ( fields ) { return rq ( https://login.remote.web ) . then ( $ = { // the result is automatically wrapped with cheerio and you can use it like jQuery const form = { form : { login : fields . login , password : fields . password , csrf_token : $ ( [name= csrf_token ] ). val (), } } return rq ({ method : POST , form }) }) . then ( $ = rq ( https://admin.remote.web/bills )) . then ( $ = { return [{ date : moment ( $ ( #bill_date )), value : $ ( #bill_value )}] }) . then ( entries = addData ( entries , io.cozy.bills )) }) What does the yarn deploy command do ? This will deploy a compiled version of your connector in a dedicated branch of your git repository using git-directory-deploy . This deployed version can then be referenced to cozy-app-publish to deploy your connector to the registry. I want to pass secret variables to my connector without hardcoding it in the source code COZY_PARAMETERS environment variable will help you. In standalone mode or dev mode, you can init it in konnector-dev-config.json : COZY_PARAMETERS : { secret : { mySecretKey : s3cr3tk3y } } In your connector, you will get these secrets as a second parameter in your main function. module . exports = new BaseKonnector ( start ) async function start ( fields , cozyParameters ) { log ( info , cozyParameters . secret . mySecretKey ) } // - s3cr3tk3y If you want to know how this works in a real cozy, you can find more information on Stack documentation","title":"Develop a Connector"},{"location":"tutorials/konnector/#introduction","text":"A connector (also known as konnector ) is a script that imports data from another web service and put those data into your cozy.

As indicated in the README.md file, just run: yarn standalone # or npm run standalone The very first run will create a konnector-dev-config.json file that allows you to configure the connector input when executing it with the CLI. This configuration comes from [Cozy Collect] when deployed. { COZY_URL : http://cozy.tools:8080 , fields : { // configuration injected to the start function } } The fields property allows you to set credentials for the targeted web service, such as login and password as if they come from Cozy Stack (so from a real Cozy Cloud instance). You can add as many fields as the targeted service needs. The COZY_URL property will be used later. You do not need to change it for now. As explained earlier, the demo website books.toscrape.com does not need any credentials. But for the code to run without error, you need to register a fake login and a fake password: { COZY_URL : http://cozy.tools:8080 , fields : { login : zuck.m@rk.fb , password : 123456 } } In the template, this configuration file is already added to .gitignore file to be sure your credentials stay private. Now you can run the connector again in standalone mode to see how jpg and related data are downloaded. In this mode, [ cozy-client-js ] is stubbed and all data meant to be saved in a cozy are displayed in the standard output and files are saved in the ./data directory of the connector. This is useful to start developing your connector without handling the state of a real Cozy Stack . Please check CLI section of the documentation for more information.","title":"Run the sample"},{"location":"tutorials/konnector/#implement-your-connector","text":"There are four steps for a connector to save data to Cozy Stack : authentication request data parse and format data save data to cozy stack You can see these steps in the src/index.js in the konnectors/template : async function start ( fields ) { // step 1. log ( info , Authenticating ... ) await authenticate ( fields . login , fields . password ) log ( info , Successfully logged in ) // step 2. // The BaseKonnector instance expects a Promise as return of the function log ( info , Fetching the list of documents ) const $ = await request ( ` ${ baseUrl } /index.html` ) // step 3. log ( info , Parsing list of documents ) const documents = await parseDocuments ( $ ) // step 4. // here we use the saveBills function even if what we fetch are not bills, but this is the most // common case in connectors log ( info , Saving data to Cozy ) await saveBills ( documents , fields . folderPath , { // this is a bank identifier which will be used to link bills to bank operations.

The very first step is to be able to authenticate to the remote service, this is done with the line: note: don t forget to add your additional fields if you have some. await authenticate ( fields . login , fields . password ) There are many obstacles at this level: is there a captcha? is there a 2FA? how is the form ? note: if the remote service exposes an API, you should use classical request call. Let s say the remote service exposes a simple classical form like https://www.trainline.eu/signin: form id = signin-form novalidate = class = signin__form data-ember-action = data-ember-action-680 = 680 input name = email autocomplete = on placeholder = Email Address id = ember691 class = ember-text-field textfield ember-view data-enpass . usermodified = yes type = email input name = password autocomplete = on placeholder = Password id = ember696 class = ember-text-field textfield ember-view data-enpass . usermodified = yes type = password div class = signin__forgot span data-ember-action = data-ember-action-697 = 697 a href = /password id = ember698 class = ember-view Forgot your password? / a / span / div div class = signin__buttons div class = signin__buttons-block button type = submit class = signin__button Sign In / button / div / div / form Find a CSS selector for the form tag: form#signin-form . Find the name of the input tags used to host user s credentials: email and password . You are ready to complete the signin(options) object called in the authenticate(username, password) function: function authenticate ( username , password ) { return signin ({ url : `https://www.trainline.eu/signin` , formSelector : form#signin-form , formData : { email : username , password }, // email and password correspond to the name attribut of the HTML inputs validate : ( statusCode , $ ) = { // write some code to validate the form submission } }) } To implement the validate function, you need to check what is happening on a successful login and on an unsuccessful login. With the https://www.trainline.eu/signin example, fill the form with wrong credentials, open your browser s devtools (and check the network tab) and submit the form. Here it is clear, on incorrect credentials, the response have a status code 422 : HTTP/2.0 422 No Reason Phrase Do the same with valid credentials. HTTP/2.0 200 OK Then you can write a simple and straight forward validate code: function authenticate ( username , password ) { return signin ({ url : `https://www.trainline.eu/signin` , formSelector : form#signin-form , formData : { email : username , password }, validate : ( statusCode , $ ) = { return statusCode === 200 || log ( error , Invalid credentials ) } }) } However if the target website doesn t use statusCode correctly you can also use fullResponse.request.uri.href to check if there is a redirection to a page that requires to be logged in : validate : ( statusCode , $ , fullResponse ) = { return fullResponse . request . uri . href == https://example.com/account || log ( error , Invalid credentials ) } It is also possible to use Cheerio to check if an HTML element is present in the web page or not : validate : ( statusCode , $ ) = { return $ ( a[href= https://example.com/logout ] ). length == 1 || log ( error , $ ( .error ). text ()) }","title":"Authentication"},{"location":"tutorials/konnector/#request-data","text":"Once the connector is able to be authenticated by the online service, the next step is to fetch data. The most common case is that the invoices we want to fetch are listed in a HTML page. So to request data, we fetch the target webpage that contains invoices list. But sometimes, the webpage is a JavaScript page that uses a JSON API URL. JSON is easier to parse than full HTML webpages. For the purpose of this guide, let s consider we are in the case of a full HTML webpage, like the service given as an example in the template: http://books.toscrape.com This is the easiest part, just fetch the webpage: const $ = await request ( http://books.toscrape.com/index.html ) The $ variable is set to a cheerio object with useful API to crawl the webpage . \u2139 You can name this variable as you want and create as many as you want Cheerio variables such as : $doc or $page . That object will be very useful for the next step.","title":"Request data"},{"location":"tutorials/konnector/#parse-the-document","text":"We want to get every article / of the page in a JavaScript Array: const articles = []. map . call ( $ ( article , node = node )) For every book, we want to catch the title attribute of this tag article h3 a . This is a CSS Selector that cheerio understands to select some part of the tree. In order to crawl a list of items to create an Array of JSON object, we can create our own function or use the function scrape from the connector libs : const docs = scrape ( $ , { title : { sel : h3 a , attr : title }, amount : { sel : .price_color , parse : normalizePrice }, url : { sel : h3 a , attr : href , parse : url = ` ${ baseUrl } / ${ url } ` }, fileurl : { sel : img , attr : src , parse : src = ` ${ baseUrl } / ${ src } ` }, filename : { sel : h3 a , attr : title , parse : title = ` ${ title } .jpg` } }, article ) Keep in mind that there are many useful CSS Pseudo-classes and Combinators that you can use in your CSS selectors to help you select HTML elements. This code will loop on article / and for each item will create a JSON object with the selector sel and the value of attribute attr if specified, otherwise it takes the value of the child node, this value can be edited with the parse function. Here is a sample for the following markup from http://books.toscrape.com: article class = product_pod div class = image_container a href = catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html img src = media/cache/2c/da/2cdad67c44b002e7ead0cc35693c0e8b.jpg alt = A Light in the Attic class = thumbnail / a / div p class = star-rating Three i class = icon-star / i i class = icon-star / i i class = icon-star / i i class = icon-star / i i class = icon-star / i / p h3 a href = catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html title = A Light in the Attic A Light in the ... / a / h3 div class = product_price p class = price_color \u00a351.77 / p p class = instock availability i class = icon-ok / i In stock / p form button type = submit class = btn btn-primary btn-block data-loading-text = Adding... Add to basket / button / form / div / article And we will get the following JSON object: { title : A Light in the Attic , amount : 51.77 , url : http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html , fileurl : http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/2c/da/2cdad67c44b002e7ead0cc35693c0e8b.jpg , filename : A Light in the Attic.jpg } fileurl is used to tell Cozy where to find the file (here an image) to retreive. Then you can save it to Cozy Stack (see section below). There are many document types (Doctypes) you can store in your Cozy, such as : - Bills - Contacts - Bank - and so on\u2026 The code sample includes some other function to manipulate the result object, but we have the idea. Once we build a correct object, we can save it to Cozy Stack.","title":"Parse the document"},{"location":"tutorials/konnector/#save-data-to-cozy-stack","text":"In the example we use some built-in function to save a bill to the Cozy Stack.

Updated \u00b1 twice a month. cozy-couchdb and cozy-nsjail are temporary packages. They will be removed when official couchdb and nsjail will be available You can choose to install cozy-couchdb on the same host as cozy-stack , or use a remote CouchDB server. Cozy only needs a 2.x CouchDB (1.x not supported). Like CouchDB, you can choose to install your reverse proxy on the same host, or use a remote one. Right now cozy-coclyco supports only local nginx . If you want to use apache2 or remote reverse proxy, you need to manually configure it for vhost or TLS certificate issuances. Prerequisites Third party repositories Let s Encrypt official packages require to use unofficial/third party repositories to have recent and supported version of ACME libraries. Packages provided by standard Debian repositories are quite old and not compatible with cozy-coclyco . For Debian/Raspbian, you need to enable backports repository . Refer to the certbot documentation to activate needed repositories. (You don t need to install packages like certbot or python-certbot-xxx , only to activate repositories.) You may change your APT preferences to allow APT to install from backports/ppa by default instead of from official repositories. For example: echo Package: python3-acme Pin: release n=stretch-backports Pin-Priority: 510 /etc/apt/preferences.d/cozy Cozy repositories First, install the packages required to install cozy apt install ca-certificates apt-transport-https wget Then, fetch the GPG Cozy signing key: wget https://apt.cozy.io/cozy-keyring.deb dpkg -i cozy-keyring.deb Finally, setup your repository. Select the channel that best fit your needs: For now, we recommend to use testing repositories. stable packages are quite old and currently provide deprecated and unsecured CouchDB version (2.0.x). Adapt your sources.list accordingly. Supported repositories are: Debian Stretch (9.x) deb https://apt.cozy.io/debian/ stretch stable deb https://apt.cozy.io/debian/ stretch testing Raspbian Stretch (9.x) deb https://apt.cozy.io/raspbian/ stretch stable deb https://apt.cozy.io/raspbian/ stretch testing echo deb https://apt.cozy.io/debian/ stretch testing /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cozy.list apt update Setup For the rest of this document, we assume you install components one by one to allow intermediate verification For a full local environment ( couchdb + nginx + cozy ), just install the cozy package which can install all needed packages in one shot. CouchDB apt install cozy-couchdb Install CouchDB in standalone mode Configure CouchDB to listen on 127.0.0.1 Pick an administrator password (This password is used by shell scripts, so currently avoid to use one with simple or double quotes or others shell meaningfull symbols. We advice you to choose one with only alphanumeric digits to avoid troubles.) At this point, you must have a working CouchDB instance curl http://localhost:5984/ { couchdb : Welcome , version : 2.1.0 , features : [ scheduler ] , vendor : { name : The Apache Software Foundation }} Cozy stack apt install cozy-stack Cozy need to create a CouchDB administrator and so to connect as admin to the CouchDB. Fill those mandatory parameters to allow this creation: Address: by default, it s localhost:5984 Node name: by default, it s couchdb@localhost Admin user: by default, it s admin Admin password: put the one you choose during CouchDB setup Cozy user: by default, it s cozy Cozy password: pick a password (Those passwords are used by shell scripts, so currently avoid to use ones with simple or double quotes or others shell meaningfull symbols. We advice you to choose ones with only alphanumeric digits to avoid troubles.) For stack management (create instances, install applications ), Cozy need an administrator password . So pick a new one. When invoking cozy-stack (or cozy-coclyco which use it under the hood), you need to set the COZY_ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variable with this password. You can put it on your .bashrc for simplier life if you want. If you don t, cozy-stack will simply ask for it. At this point, you must have a working Cozy stack, depending on the branch you ve chosen you can get a different version displayed. curl http://localhost:8080/version { build_mode : production , build_time : 2017-09-28T10:26:03Z , runtime_version : go1.8.1 , version : 0.1.0 } # If you want to use konnectors, you need to initialize the NodeJS chroot (Currently this script only works for Debian and will be adapted for Raspbian soon) /usr/share/cozy/konnector-create-chroot.sh You also need to enable user namespaces: sysctl -w kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone = 1 If you use a self-signed certificate or a not official certificate authority, you need to deploy the corresponding root certificate in /usr/share/cozy/chroot/etc/ssl/certs/custom.crt . For example, if you use Let s Encrypt staging environment for testing purpose : wget -q https://letsencrypt.org/certs/fakelerootx1.pem \\ -O /usr/share/cozy/chroot/etc/ssl/certs/custom.crt Finally apt install cozy Cozy instance setup DNS Cozy relies on sub-domains for each applications you installed on your instance. For an instance cozy.example.org , app .cozy.example.org must be available too. Currently, you need at least: settings.cozy.example.org drive.cozy.example.org photos.cozy.example.org home.cozy.example.org store.cozy.example.org app .cozy.example.org for each application you use Follow your usual way to create those entries on your domain zone. The simpliest way to handle this is to use a wildcard entry if supported by your domain hosting. cozy 1h IN A x.x.x.x *.cozy 1h IN CNAME cozy ACME (Let s Encrypt) Like DNS, each application will use a different sub-domain and so request a certificate which include all needed domains. cozy-coclyco use Let s Encrypt and it ACME protocol to prove your ownership over the domain you try to issue a certificate. This protocol requires your reverse proxy to be able to serve http:// app .cozy.example.org/.well-known/acme-challenge/ requests correctly. The simplest way to achieve this is to configure your reverse proxy with a generic rule to forward any /.well-known/acme-challenge/ request to the corresponding /etc /ssl/private/acme-challenge/ folder. For nginx , this can be done with / etc / nginx / sites-available / default server { listen 80 default_server ; listen [ :: ] : 80 default_server ; root /var/www/html ; server_name _ ; location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ { alias /etc/ssl/private/acme-challenge/ ; } location / { return 301 https : // $ host $ request_uri ; } } apt install ssl-cert adduser www-data ssl-cert systemctl restart nginx Create instances Once you ve got a stack, your DNS and your reverse proxy correctly configured, you can create instances on your Cozy stack.

When invoking cozy-stack (or cozy-coclyco which use it under the hood), you need to set the COZY_ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variable with this password. You can put it on your .bashrc for simplier life if you want. If you don t, cozy-stack will simply ask for it.
